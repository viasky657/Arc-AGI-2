      "1. In July 1956, Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal. The British Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, reacted by conspiring with France to orchestrate an Israeli attack on Egypt, which would provide Britain and France with a pretext to intervene militarily and reclaim the canal. However, Eden's lack of communication with US President Dwight D. Eisenhower led to Eisenhower's refusal to support the invasion. Eisenhower's main concern was the potential for a larger war with the Soviet Union, which threatened to intervene in Egypt's favor. In response to the crisis, Eisenhower threatened to sell US reserves of the British pound, potentially causing a collapse of the British currency. Despite the military success of the invasion force, UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain to withdraw its troops, resulting in a humiliating outcome, and Eden resigned as Prime Minister.\n2. In July 1956, Nasser made the decision to nationalise the Suez Canal. This action led British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to devise a plan with France to incite an Israeli attack on Egypt, which would then allow Britain and France to justify their military intervention and re-take control of the canal. However, Eden's actions did not align with US President Dwight D. Eisenhower's expectations, leading Eisenhower to refuse support for the invasion. Eisenhower was worried about the possibility of a broader conflict with the Soviet Union, as it threatened to intervene in Egypt's favor.

Ehrlich's observation of the general toxicity of arsenic and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria led him to hypothesize that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties could be used to treat bacterial infections. Arsphenamine was synthesized as part of a campaign to create such compounds, and its success as the first effective treatment for syphilis marked a significant turning point in the pharmaceutical industry."

The conclusion of the Great War and the resulting treaties of Versailles, St-Germain, Neuilly, Trianon and Sèvres witnessed the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan and the United States as the chief arbiters of the new world order. In the aftermath of World War I the German Empire was defeated, the Austria-Hungarian empire was divided into new, less powerful states and the Russian Empire fell to a revolution. During the Paris Peace Conference, the \"Big Four\"—France, Italy, United Kingdom and the United States—held noticeably more power and influence on the proceedings and outcome of the treaties than Japan. The Big Four were leading architects of the Treaty of Versailles which was signed by Germany; the Treaty of St. Germain, with Austria; the Treaty of Neuilly, with Bulgaria; the Treaty of Trianon, with Hungary; and the Treaty of Sèvres, with the Ottoman Empire. During the decision-making of the Treaty of Versailles, Italy pulled out of the conference because a part of its demands were not met and temporarily left the other three countries as the sole major architects of that treaty, referred to as the \"Big Three\".\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

      "1. Frédéric Chopin faced serious health issues starting in 1842. After a recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała about his struggle: \"I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.\" This forced him to decline an invitation from Alkan to participate in a Beethoven Seventh Symphony performance at Erard's on 1 March 1843. In 1844, during a visit from Charles Hallé, Chopin was found in a lot of pain, \"hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife.\" However, his spirits lifted when he played the piano for his visitor. Despite his deteriorating health, particularly from this time onwards, modern research suggests that apart from other illnesses, he may have also suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\n2.

Merton highlighted the relationship between religious affiliation and interest in science, proposing that the synergy between Protestant values and the principles of modern science led to the development of the scientific revolution during the 17th and 18th centuries. According to Merton, Protestant values provided a religious justification for scientific research, allowing scientists to identify and understand God's influence on the world, which he referred to as his creation.\nI have rewritten the passage in three different ways, each one focusing on the influence of Protestantism on science and the Merton Thesis.",

According to the Merton Thesis, there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other. The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values. Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science. Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God's influence on the world—his creation—and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

However, in more recent years, the Christian population has grown, and some reports suggest that it now slightly outweighs the Muslim population. In a 2012 report on religion and public life by the Pew Research Center, it was estimated that 49.3% of Nigeria's population was Christian, 48.8% was Muslim, and 1.9% adhered to indigenous or other religions.
