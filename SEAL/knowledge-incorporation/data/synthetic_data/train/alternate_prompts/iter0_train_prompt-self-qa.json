The Vedic period, spanning from c. 1500 to 500 BCE, concluded with the ascendancy of singular, monarchic states, called republics or states with sovereign kings, known as janapada (Sanskrit: जनपद), which may have functioned from around the 6th to 2nd centuries BCE. The most prominent of these were the Magadha in the east, Kuru-Panchala in the west, and Kosala-Chedi in the north-east at different times. The term janapada is derived from janapada (Sanskrit: जनपद), which has been defined in the Shulba Sutras as a unit of measurement equal to 16 villages. These kingdoms or states roughly spanned over the area from Himalaya in the north to the Deccan plateau in the south, and from eastern Pakistan in the east to Sindh and Gujarat in the west. A hierarchy of states composed of \"greater\" states, \"equal\" states, and \"lesser\" states, as well as a category of \"external\" states beyond this hierarchy, is described in the Atharvaveda and the Vedanga.\n\nTable 1:\n\n| Parameter         | Description                                                                                            |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Time Period       | From c. 2500 BCE to c. 500 BCE                                                                           |\n| Vestiges          | Vedic sources mention Aryan settlements in northwestern India                                          |\n| Vedic Period      | Spanning from c. 1500 to 500 BCE                                                                       |\n| Conclusion        | Ascendancy of singular, monarchic states (janapada)                                                   |\n| Periodization     | From 6th to 2nd centuries BCE                                                                          |\n| Regions           | From Himalaya in the north to Deccan plateau in the south, from eastern Pakistan in the east to Sindh and Gujarat in the west |\n| States            | Magadha in the east, Kuru-Panchala in the west, Kosala-Chedi in the north-east                      |\n| Terms             | Janapada (Sanskrit: जनपद) derived from janapada (Sanskrit: जनपद)                                   |\n| Measurement Unit  | 16 villages                                                                                            |\n| Vedic Elements    | Atharvaveda and the Vedanga describe a hierarchy of states                                             |\n| States Types      | Greater, equal, lesser, and external states                                                           |\n\nThis table summarizes the information provided in the passage, highlighting key elements such as the time period, vestiges, Vedic period, conclusion, regions, states, terms, measurement unit, Vedic elements, and types of states."

Upanishads form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Vedas). The older Upanishads launched attacks of increasing intensity on the ritual. Anyone who worships a divinity other than the Self is called a domestic animal of the gods in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. The Mundaka launches the most scathing attack on the ritual by comparing those who value sacrifice with an unsafe boat that is endlessly overtaken by old age and death.\n\nQuestion 1: "

    "context": "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit. There was no broken glass depicted in the film. Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers’ memories of the event. Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event – those who were asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen. The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect.",

      "What is the relationship between recording equipment and memory?\nAnswer 1: While people often think of memory as working like recording equipment, it is not the case. Memory is a very dynamic process that covers a time window from seconds to a lifetime, involving distinct phases of induction and maintenance.\n\nQuestion 2: What does it mean when we say our memories are constructed?\nAnswer 2: When we say our memories are constructed, it means that people can modify how they encode or recall memories. This is illustrated in a classic study by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer, where the wording of questions affected the accuracy of memories about a traffic accident event.\n\nQuestion 3: Can you describe the findings of the classic study by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer?\nAnswer 3: The study found that the people who were asked \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit. Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event, with those who were asked the question with smashed recalling a more serious car accident than they had actually seen.\n\nQuestion 4: What is the misinformation effect?\nAnswer 4: The misinformation effect is a phenomenon where when people are provided with misleading information, they tend to misremember, leading them to construct different memories of the event. This was demonstrated in the classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer, where the wording of the question affected the accuracy of memories about a traffic accident event.\n\nQuestion 5: How has this finding been replicated in research?\nAnswer 5: Research consistently demonstrates that when people are provided with misleading information, they tend to misremember. This finding has been replicated around the world, and researchers have used it to further explore the mechanisms of memory formation and retrieval.",
      "Can you provide a paraphrase of the passage on memory?\n\nSure! Here's a paraphrased version of the passage:\n\nMemory does not function like a passive recording device; instead, its processes are highly dynamic and involve several distinct stages, lasting from seconds to a lifetime. Studies have shown that our memories are not just passively recalled but actively constructed, both during encoding and recollection. For example, Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer conducted an experiment where participants watched a video of a car accident and were later asked about what they observed. The results indicated that the phrasing of the questions influenced their recall, showing that how a question was phrased can lead individuals to remember events differently. Specifically, those who heard the term \"smashed\" recalled a more severe accident than those who heard \"hit,\" and they were twice as likely to report seeing broken glass, which wasn't present in the video. These findings were replicated across multiple studies, demonstrating that misleading information can cause people to construct inaccurate memories of an event—a phenomenon called the misinformation effect.",
      "How dynamic are the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory?\nAnswer: The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic.\n\nQuestion 2: What phases does the dynamic molecular mechanism of memory cover?\nAnswer: The dynamic molecular mechanism of memory covers a time window from seconds to even a lifetime.\n\nQuestion 3: How do people's memories get constructed?\nAnswer: People's memories are constructed when they encode them and/or when they recall them.\n\nQuestion 4: What is the misinformation effect and how was it demonstrated?\nAnswer: The misinformation effect is a phenomenon where people's memories are distorted due to misleading information. This effect was demonstrated in a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974).\n\nQuestion 5: What was the difference in the wording of the questions in the Loftus and Palmer study?\nAnswer: The wording of the questions in the Loftus and Palmer study differed between \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" and \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" \n\nQuestion 6: Did the presence of broken glass in the film influence the participants' memories?\nAnswer: No, there was no broken glass depicted in the film.\n\nQuestion 7: What is the overall implication of this study?\nAnswer: The study shows that when people are provided with misleading information, they tend to misremember, demonstrating that people's memories can be constructed and manipulated.",
      "What do people often think memory operates like? \nAnswer 1: Recording equipment.\n\nQuestion 2:  What are the distinct phases of the molecular mechanisms underlying memory? \nAnswer 2: The induction and maintenance of memory.\n\nQuestion 3:  How long do these phases cover? \nAnswer 3: From seconds to even a lifetime.\n\nQuestion 4:  Is memory constructed? \nAnswer 4: Yes.\n\nQuestion 5:  What classic study by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer demonstrated that people can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them? \nAnswer 5: The study where people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw.\n\nQuestion 6:  What was the difference between the questions asked in the classic study? \nAnswer 6: The people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\"\n\nQuestion 7:  What phenomenon did researchers consistently demonstrate in the study? \nAnswer 7: Misinformation effect.\n\nQuestion 8:  What did the participants in the study misremember according to the study? \nAnswer 8: That they have seen broken glass in the film.",

Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses.

Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path.

It was a series of four distinct engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte from 23 to 26 October 1944. Leyte Gulf featured the largest battleships ever built, was the last time in history that battleships engaged each other, and was also notable as the first time that kamikaze aircraft were used. Allied victory in the Philippine Sea established Allied air and sea superiority in the western Pacific. Nimitz favored blockading the Philippines and landing on Formosa. This would give the Allies control of the sea routes to Japan from southern Asia, cutting off substantial Japanese garrisons. MacArthur favored an invasion of the Philippines, which also lay across the supply lines to Japan. Roosevelt adjudicated in favor of the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japanese Combined Fleet Chief Toyoda Soemu prepared four plans to cover all Allied offensive scenarios. On 12 October Nimitz launched a carrier raid against Formosa to make sure that planes based there could not intervene in the landings on Leyte. Toyoda put Plan Sho-2 into effect, launching a series of air attacks against the U.S. carriers. However the Japanese lost 600 planes in three days, leaving them without air cover.",

The destruction of Japanese ships and aircraft also reduced Japan's capacity to conduct further offensive operations in the Pacific theater. The battle was a critical turning point in the war, and ultimately led to Japan's surrender in August 1945.\n\nQuestion 3: Can you provide some specific examples of the impact of the Battle of Leyte Gulf on Japan?\n\nAnswer 3: The Battle of Leyte Gulf had a number of specific impacts on Japan. For example, the loss of aircraft carriers and ships meant that Japan was unable to provide air cover and support for its forces in the Pacific. The destruction of so many ships also limited Japan's ability to provide supplies and reinforcements to its soldiers and sailors fighting in the region. In addition, the battle severely damaged Japan's prestige and military morale, which made it even more difficult for Japan to regain its military footing in the war.",

These are collectively denoted as \"extrapulmonary tuberculosis\". Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in immunosuppressed persons and young children. In those with HIV, this occurs in more than 50% of cases. Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura (in tuberculous pleurisy), the central nervous system (in tuberculous meningitis), the lymphatic system (in scrofula of the neck), the genitourinary system (in urogenital tuberculosis), and the bones and joints (in Pott disease of the spine), among others. When it spreads to the bones, it is also known as \"osseous tuberculosis\", a form of osteomyelitis. Sometimes, bursting of a tubercular abscess through skin results in tuberculous ulcer. An ulcer originating from nearby infected lymph nodes is painless, slowly enlarging and has an appearance of \"wash leather\". A potentially more serious, widespread form of TB is called \"disseminated tuberculosis\", also known as miliary tuberculosis. Miliary TB makes up about 10% of extrapulmonary cases.\n\nQuestion 1: "

He was ordained priest on 29 May 1920 in Brescia and celebrated his first Holy Mass in Brescia in the Basilica of Santa Maria delle Grazie. Montini concluded his studies in Milan with a doctorate in Canon Law in the same year. Afterwards he studied at the Gregorian University, the University of Rome La Sapienza and, at the request of Giuseppe Pizzardo at the Accademia dei Nobili Ecclesiastici. At the age of twenty-five, again at the request of Giuseppe Pizzardo, Montini entered the Secretariat of State in 1922, where he worked under Pizzardo together with Francesco Borgongini-Duca, Alfredo Ottaviani, Carlo Grano, Domenico Tardini and Francis Spellman. Consequently, he spent not a day as a parish priest. In 1925 he helped found the publishing house Morcelliana in Brescia, focused on promoting a 'Christian inspired culture'.\n\nQuestion 1: "

Some show promise including: limiting smoke exposure both in utero and after delivery, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication. Early pet exposure may be useful. Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet. Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended. Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective. It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations effects the risk of exacerbations. Immunization; however, is recommended by the World Health Organization. Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.\n\nQuestion 1: "

      "What is law of the united states?\nAnswer 1: Law of the United States refers to the comprehensive legal system that governs the 50 U.S. states and their citizens. The system consists of federal law and treaties, as well as state law, which can vary greatly from one state to the next.\n\nQuestion 2: How does the dual-sovereign system of American federalism affect state and federal law?\nAnswer 2: The dual-sovereign system of American federalism establishes a balance between state and federal sovereignty. In this system, states have plenary (full) sovereign power, while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority enumerated in the Constitution. As a result, state law may grant their citizens broader rights than federal law, as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the significance of federal preemption in the United States?\nAnswer 3: Federal preemption in the United States refers to the principle that federal law and treaties preempt conflicting state and territorial laws, so long as they are in accordance with the Constitution. This means that if there is a conflict between federal law and state law, federal law generally prevails. However, the scope of federal preemption is limited by the scope of federal power, which is not universal.\n\nQuestion 4: What primarily makes up most of the laws experienced by the majority of U.S. citizens on a day-to-day basis?\nAnswer 4: Most of the laws experienced by the majority of U.S. citizens on a day-to-day basis primarily consist of state law, as the federal law and treaties governing the U.S. states tend to focus more on specific areas such as commerce, taxation, and foreign affairs.\n\nCan you provide me with examples of state law that grant citizens broader rights than federal law?\nCertainly! Here are a few examples of state laws that grant citizens broader rights than federal law:\n\n1. Marijuana legalization: Several states, such as California, Colorado, and Oregon, have legalized marijuana for recreational use, despite it remaining illegal under federal law. These states have established strict regulations and licensing requirements for the sale and distribution of marijuana.\n\n2. Gun control: In recent years, several states have enacted stricter gun control laws than those set forth by the federal government. For example, California has enacted some of the toughest gun laws in the country, requiring background checks for all firearms sales and imposing stricter restrictions on the sale of semiautomatic firearms.\n\n3. Same-sex marriage: Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, several states had legalized same-sex marriage, such as Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Iowa, despite it being prohibited by federal law at the time.\n\n4. Environmental protections: Some states have implemented more stringent environmental regulations than those set forth by the federal government. For example, California has some of the most stringent emissions standards in the country, requiring that all new cars sold in the state meet strict emissions standards.\n\nThese are just a few examples of state laws that grant citizens broader rights than federal law. In each case, the states have chosen to enact more comprehensive and protective measures than those required by the federal government.\n\nCan you elaborate more on how federal law and treaties preempt conflicting state laws and what kind of laws fall under this preemption?\nCertainly! The Supremacy Clause in the United States Constitution establishes that federal law and treaties have precedence over conflicting state laws. This means that if there is a conflict between federal law or a treaty and a state law, federal law or the treaty generally takes precedence. There are two primary situations in which federal law and treaties may preempt state laws:\n\n1. Conflicting laws: In this situation, a state law is deemed preempted by federal law if it directly conflicts with the text or purpose of a federal law or treaty. For example, a state law that regulated the interstate commerce of goods could be preempted by a federal law that prohibits states from interfering with interstate commerce.\n\n2. Field preemption: In this situation, a state law is deemed preempted by federal law if the subject matter of the state law falls within a field that Congress intended to occupy exclusively. In these cases, states are prohibited from passing any laws that would interfere with or modify the federal laws. For example, the federal government has the power to regulate railroad safety, and thus, state laws that regulate railroad safety would be preempted by federal law.\n\nIt is important to note that the scope of federal preemption is limited. Federal law and treaties only preempts conflicting state laws to the extent that they are in accordance with the Constitution. Additionally, Congress may expressly grant states the authority to pass laws that supplement or qualify federal law.\n\nOverall, the purpose of federal preemption is to ensure that there is a uniform legal standard across the United States, and that federal laws and treaties are fully enforced.",

Given that there is no agreement among all Christians on the circumstances of the death, Dormition or Assumption of Mary, the feast of assumption is celebrated among some denominations and not others.  While the Catholic Church celebrates the Feast of the Assumption on August 15, some Eastern Catholics celebrate it as Dormition of the Theotokos, and may do so on August 28, if they follow the Julian calendar. The Eastern Orthodox also celebrate it as the Dormition of the Theotokos, one of their 12 Great Feasts. Protestants do not celebrate this, or any other Marian feasts.\n\nQuestion 1: "

      "What was the method for calculation?\nAnswer 1: The method of calculation for the Gregorian calendar involved modifying the mean length of the calendar year and dealing with the accumulated difference between the actual and computational lengths. This included fixing the vernal equinox at 21 March and setting the earliest date for Easter at 22 March, ensuring that the full moon preceding Easter did not precede the equinox.\n\nQuestion 2:  What was done to deal with the accumulated difference?\nAnswer 2: To deal with the accumulated difference between the actual mean length of the calendar year and the Gregorian computational length, 10 days were removed.\n\nQuestion 3:  What was the purpose of this?\nAnswer 3: The purpose of removing 10 days was to align the calendar with the actual astronomical events, specifically to fix the vernal equinox at 21 March and to ensure that Easter would never fall before the equinox.\n\nQuestion 4:  How did the canonical Easter tables contribute to this?\nAnswer 4: The canonical Easter tables, devised at the end of the third century, provided the basis for determining the date of Easter. These tables specified that Easter should fall on the Sunday after the first full moon that occurred on or after the vernal equinox. In order to accommodate this rule, the Gregorian calendar was adjusted to set the earliest date for Easter at 22 March.\n\nQuestion 5:  What was the consequence of this adjustment?\nAnswer 5: The consequence of this adjustment was that the difference between the actual mean length of the calendar year and the Gregorian computational length was narrowed to 10 minutes 48 seconds per year, ensuring greater alignment with astronomical events.",

This caused the vernal equinox, which marked the start of spring, to drift backwards in the calendar over time, leading to a mismatch between the calendar and the astronomical seasons.\n\nQuestion 6:  How did the Gregorian calendar address the issue of the drifting equinox?\nAnswer 6:  The Gregorian calendar reduced the mean length of the calendar year from 365.25 days to 365.2425 days, a difference of 10 minutes 48 seconds per year. Additionally, it introduced adjustments to the leap year rule to further minimize the difference.\n\nQuestion 7:  What was the impact of the Gregorian calendar adjustments on the position of Easter in the calendar?\nAnswer 7:  The canonical Easter tables, which were used to determine the date of Easter, were also affected by the calendar changes. Easter is defined as the Sunday after the first full moon on or after the vernal equinox. The Gregorian calendar restored the equinox to 21 March and the earliest date for Easter to 22 March, resulting in an earlier Easter date than in the Julian calendar.\n\nQuestion 8:  How did the Gregorian calendar reduction in length benefit modern timekeeping?\nAnswer 8:  The reduced length of the Gregorian calendar allowed for greater accuracy in timekeeping, making it easier to synchronize clocks and standardize time across different regions. It also made it possible to predict astronomical events more accurately and to maintain a consistent calendar across different seasons.\n\nQuestion 9:  Were there any significant changes made to the calendar year during the Gregorian calendar reform?\nAnswer 9:  The Gregorian calendar reform made several changes to the calendar year, including:\n- Removing 10 days to synchronize the calendar with the astronomical seasons.\n- Adjusting the leap year rule to include three conditions:\n  1. Divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless:\n  2. Divisible by 400.\n- Including the provision for further adjustments in the future, such as eliminating one leap day every 3,200 years.",

Can you please give me more information on the early years of house music and how it originated?\nAnswer: Sure, I'd be happy to give you more information on the early years of house music and how it originated.\n\nHouse music is a genre that originated in the United States during the 1980s in Chicago's South Side clubs. It started as an alternative to disco music, which was becoming less popular at the time. The first house tracks were produced by DJs like Frankie Knuckles, who were experimenting with electronic dance music in their underground clubs. These DJs began to add synthesizers, drum machines, and other electronic instruments to create a new sound.\n\nAs house music gained popularity in Chicago, it began to spread to other parts of the country and the world. In the 1980s, DJs from Detroit, New York, and other cities started producing their own house tracks. House music became more mainstream in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the rise of radio-friendly house tracks like \"I Want It\" by Point of Grace and \"Love Break\" by Roger Smith.\n\nIn the 1990s, house music continued to evolve and branch out into subgenres like acid house, hard house, and deep house. It also began to incorporate more elements of other genres, like jazz, R&B, and soul. Today, house music is a globally popular genre with a wide range of styles and subgenres.\n\nInteresting, I didn't know that house music originated in Chicago. Can you tell me more about the club scene in Chicago where the music first became popular?\nAnswer: Of course! The club scene in Chicago was a major driving force behind the origin of house music. In the 1970s and 1980s, the South Side of Chicago was home to a thriving club scene, with many small clubs hosting DJs who played dance music on weekends.\n\nOne of the most important clubs in the early days of house music was the Warehouse Club, which opened in 1977. The Warehouse was a popular spot for DJs to showcase their mixes and experiment with new sounds. Frankie Knuckles, who is often called the \"Godfather of House Music,\" was one of the DJs who played at the Warehouse. He quickly became known for his innovative mixes and his use of electronic instruments to create new sounds.\n\nAnother important club in the Chicago scene was the Music Box, which opened in 1985. The Music Box was owned by Gene \"Mad Mike\" Kelly, who also owned the Warehouse. Kelly began to promote house music in the late 1980s and helped to spread it to other parts of the world. The Music Box quickly became a popular spot for DJs and dancers, and helped to establish Chicago as a major hub for house music.\n\nOverall, the club scene in Chicago played a crucial role in the development of house music. It was a place where DJs could experiment with new sounds, and where fans could come together to enjoy the music. The South Side of Chicago was a vital part of the early days of house music, and remains an important center for the genre today.",

The writer uses this imagery to further convey his disdain for urbanization and how it has turned New York into a place of hardship. In addition, the writer suggests that the advancement of modern conveniences has caused society to become physically and mentally unacquainted with the countryside, leading to a sense of malaise and alienation.\nIn contrast to the writer's comments, what advice does Paolo Martelli offer on the preservation of urban life?  In what ways does Martelli advocate for the inclusion of natural surroundings to prevent urban decay and the inevitable decline of cities? Paolo Martelli offers several suggestions for the preservation of urban life. Firstly, he advocates for a focus on city planning, which he believes can make cities more resilient and sustainable. He suggests incorporating more green spaces and public areas into urban design to improve quality of life and mitigate the negative effects of urbanization. Secondly, he emphasizes the importance of promoting mixed-use development, which combines residential, commercial, and recreational spaces to foster stronger communities. This approach can help combat sprawl and promote a more connected, walkable urban environment.\n\nMoreover, Martelli proposes the integration of more natural elements into urban planning, such as parks, gardens, and green roofs, to create a healthier, more sustainable city environment. He argues that this approach can not only improve residents' quality of life but also help preserve urban wildlife and combat the negative environmental effects of urbanization. Overall, Martelli's vision for urban planning prioritizes sustainability, social connectedness, and a harmonious integration of natural and built environments, offering a compelling alternative to the sprawl and decline of urban centers that the writer laments."

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a question-answer format.\n\nPassage:\nHouse music\nEarly house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent kick drum on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric deep house to the more minimalistic microhouse. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres, such as euro house, tech house, electro house and jump house.\n\nQuestion 1: "

Some people prefer simply to follow an individual's self-definition or identity. Scientific and professional understanding is that \"the core attractions that form the basis for adult sexual orientation typically emerge between middle childhood and early adolescence\". Sexual orientation differs from sexual identity in that it encompasses relationships with others, while sexual identity is a concept of self.\n\nQuestion 1: "

    "prompt": "Let's read the following passage and rewrite it in a question-answer format.\n\nPassage:\nHunter-gatherer\nHunter-gatherer societies manifest significant variability, depending on climate zone/life zone, available technology and societal structure. Archaeologists examine hunter-gatherer tool kits to measure variability across different groups. Collard et al. (2005) found temperature to be the only statistically significant factor to impact hunter-gatherer tool kits. Using temperature as a proxy for risk, Collard et al.'s results suggest that environments with extreme temperatures pose a threat to hunter-gatherer systems significant enough to warrant increased variability of tools. These results support Torrence's (1989) theory that risk of failure is indeed the most important factor in determining the structure of hunter-gatherer toolkits.\n\nQuestion 1: "
