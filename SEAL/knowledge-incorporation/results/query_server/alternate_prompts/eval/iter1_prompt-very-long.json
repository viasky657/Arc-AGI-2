In theory, this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually \"leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods\" to implement. In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves. Directives do not have so called \"horizontal\" direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties). This view was instantly controversial, and in the early 1990s three Advocate Generals persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens.

          "text": "1. European Union law is governed by the Treaties and Regulations, which have direct effect, meaning they are immediately applicable and enforceable.\n2. Directives do not generally give citizens standing to sue other citizens, as they are addressed to member states and leave the choice of form and methods to implement them.\n3. This is due to the fact that Directives often create minimum standards, allowing member states to apply higher standards.\n4. For instance, the Working Time Directive requires at least 4 weeks paid holidays annually, but member states can implement more stringent requirements.\n5. Citizens can sue to enforce Directives through national laws that implement them, but not directly from the Directives themselves.\n6. Directives do not have \"horizontal\" direct effect, meaning they do not create rights and duties between non-state parties.\n7. This position was adopted by the Court of Justice, despite dissenting opinions from three Advocate Generals in the early 1990s, who argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens.\n8. The Court of Justice's stance on Directives has remained unchanged, with the exceptions mentioned below.\n9. The lack of direct effect for Directives is likely due to the desire to maintain flexibility and allow member states to tailor implementation to their specific needs and circumstances.\n10. The exceptions to the general principle of no direct effect for Directives may provide a basis for citizens to bring legal action in certain circumstances.\n11. These exceptions likely include situations where the Directive creates a new legal obligation or a significant change in the legal landscape, making it more direct and enforceable.\n12. The exceptions may also be influenced by the specific context of each Directive and its objectives.\n13. The lack of direct effect for Directives may limit the ability of citizens to directly enforce their rights under EU law, but they can still rely on national laws implementing the Directives.\n14. This approach allows for a balance between the need for uniformity and the flexibility required for member states to tailor implementation to their specific needs.\n15. The continued evolution of European Union law and jurisprudence may lead to changes in the direct effect of Directives in the future.\n16. The indirect effects of Directives, such as influencing national laws and shaping the legal landscape, are still significant and can have a substantial impact on citizens.\n17. The Court of Justice's stance on the direct effect of Directives may be subject to reevaluation as European Union law and jurisprudence continue to evolve.\n18. The differences in implementation of Directives across member states may create legal challenges and inconsistencies, but these can be addressed through further harmonization and clarification by the Court of Justice.\n19. The absence of direct effect for Directives may lead to a greater emphasis on national legal systems in ensuring compliance and protecting citizens' rights.\n20. The indirect effects of Directives, such as shaping national laws and creating a legal framework, may still provide significant benefits for citizens by promoting consistency and fairness across member states.\n21. The lack of direct effect for Directives may limit the ability of citizens to directly challenge non-compliant member states, but the Court of Justice can still play a role in ensuring compliance and holding member states accountable.\n22. The indirect effects of Directives may also contribute to the development of a pan-European legal culture and a shared understanding of citizens' rights and obligations.\n23. The Court of Justice's interpretation of Directives may have broader implications for the role of national courts in enforcing EU law, as they may need to take into account the spirit and objectives of the Directives when applying national laws.\n24. The lack of direct effect for Directives may lead to a greater emphasis on public awareness and education about EU law, as citizens may need to understand national laws and their implementation to exercise their rights effectively.\n25. The indirect effects of Directives may provide opportunities for civil society organizations and other stakeholders to play a more active role in monitoring compliance and promoting the rule of law at the national level.\n26. The absence of direct effect for Directives may limit the ability of citizens to directly influence the implementation process, but it also allows for a more flexible and adaptable approach to implementation.\n27. The Court of Justice's interpretation of Directives may have implications for the role of the European Commission in monitoring and enforcing compliance with EU law.\n28. The indirect effects of Directives may contribute to the development of a more coherent and integrated European legal system, even if citizens cannot directly enforce their rights under the Directives themselves.\n29. The Court of Justice's interpretation of Directives may also have implications for the relationship between the European Union and its member states, as it may shape the balance of power and influence between the EU and its national authorities.\n30. The lack of direct effect for Directives may limit the ability of citizens to directly challenge member states for non-compliance, but the Court of Justice can still provide a mechanism for review and remedy through its case law and decisions.",

He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. \"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan’s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,\" Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. \"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,\" Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth.

He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. \"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan’s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,\" Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. \"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,\" Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth. In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country.\n\nImplications:\n"

Immune system can generate long-term active memory to fight against specific pathogens.\n3. Active immunity can be acquired naturally through infection or artificially through vaccination.\n4. Vaccination stimulates the immune system to develop specific immunity against a particular pathogen without causing the disease itself.\n5. Vaccination is an effective way to induce an immune response and protect against infectious diseases.\n6. The specificity of the immune system is a key aspect of its ability to generate an effective immune response.\n7. Vaccination is a deliberate manipulation of the immune system and is one of the most effective ways to combat infectious diseases.\n8. Infectious diseases are still a leading cause of death in the human population, highlighting the importance of vaccination and the immune system in protecting human health.\n9. Vaccines work by introducing antigens from a pathogen, which triggers an immune response and prepares the body to recognize and fight the actual pathogen if exposed.\n10. Specificity of the immune response allows the immune system to differentiate between harmless and harmful organisms, minimizing the risk of overreacting to non-threatening substances.\n11. Vaccines can help to prevent the spread of infectious diseases by creating herd immunity, where a significant portion of the population is immune, thus protecting those who are not immune.\n12. Vaccination is a cost-effective public health intervention that can save lives and reduce healthcare costs.\n13. The immune system's ability to generate long-term memory helps to provide lasting protection against pathogens.\n14. Vaccines are designed to mimic a natural infection, stimulating the immune system to produce a similar response to protect against the actual pathogen.\n15. The immune system's ability to recognize and remember pathogens allows for a faster and more effective response upon future exposure.\n16. Vaccination can help to eradicate infectious diseases by reducing their prevalence and spreading in the population.\n17. The immune system's response to vaccination can be measured through serological tests, which detect antibodies produced in response to the vaccine.\n18. Vaccines can be administered in various ways, including injection, nasal spray, and oral administration.\n19. Vaccination is a collective effort that benefits both the individual and the community by reducing the overall burden of infectious diseases.\n20. Immunization programs are essential for public health, particularly in regions with limited healthcare resources and high infectious disease prevalence.\n21. The immune system's response to vaccination can vary among individuals, with factors such as age, health status, and prior exposure to the pathogen affecting the effectiveness of vaccination.\n22. Vaccines can be developed using various strategies, including inactivated or attenuated pathogens, subunit antigens, and recombinant technology.\n23. Vaccination can provide not only individual protection but also indirect protection for those who are not vaccinated, through the phenomenon of herd immunity.\n24. Vaccination can also help to control outbreaks of infectious diseases by quickly establishing herd immunity and preventing the spread of the pathogen.\n25. The immune system's response to vaccination is generally well-tolerated, with potential side effects being mild and short-lived.\n26. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of vaccination programs are essential to ensure their effectiveness and safety.\n27. Vaccination can play a role in controlling and preventing the emergence of vaccine-resistant pathogens.\n28. Vaccination can be particularly important for vulnerable populations, such as young children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised immune systems.\n29. The immune system's response to vaccination can be influenced by factors such as nutrition, stress, and other health conditions.\n30. Vaccination is a critical component of preventive healthcare, promoting overall health and well-being.\n31. Vaccination can contribute to global health security by reducing the risk of pandemics and preventing the spread of infectious diseases across borders.\n32. Vaccination can help to ensure the sustainability of healthcare systems by reducing the burden of infectious diseases and associated healthcare costs.\n33. The immune system's ability to generate long-term memory and specific immunity is essential for the development of effective vaccines.\n34. Vaccination can help to promote health equity by ensuring that all individuals have access to life-saving vaccines, regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location.\n35. Vaccination can also help to address social determinants of health by promoting healthy behaviors and reducing the spread of infectious diseases within communities.\n36. Vaccination can be integrated with other public health interventions, such as vector control and sanitation, to maximize their effectiveness in preventing infectious diseases.\n37. Vaccination can be an important tool for health promotion and education, raising awareness about the importance of preventive healthcare and the benefits of vaccines.\n38. Vaccination can help to protect vulnerable populations, such as healthcare workers and those in close contact with immunocompromised individuals.\n39. Vaccination can be an effective strategy for controlling the spread of infectious diseases during natural disasters or other emergency situations.\n40. The immune system's response to vaccination can provide information about the effectiveness of the vaccine and the body's immune response, which can be used to inform vaccine development and improvement.\n41. Vaccination can be a cost-effective strategy for disease prevention, with the long-term benefits of reduced healthcare costs and improved health outcomes outweighing the initial investment in vaccine development and administration.\n42. Vaccination can contribute to the goal of eliminating certain infectious diseases, such as smallpox and polio, which have been successfully eradicated through widespread vaccination.\n43. Vaccination can be an important tool for addressing antimicrobial resistance, as vaccines can reduce the need for antibiotics and slow the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria.\n44. Vaccination can be an effective strategy for controlling the spread of infectious diseases in high-risk populations, such as military personnel or travelers to regions with high disease prevalence.\n45. Vaccination can be an important tool for responding to emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS-CoV-2, by rapidly developing and deploying effective vaccines to control the outbreak.\n46. Vaccination can contribute to the development of international guidelines and standards for vaccine safety and efficacy, ensuring that vaccines meet high quality standards and are safe for use in all populations.\n47. Vaccination can be an effective strategy for reducing healthcare disparities and promoting health equity, by ensuring that all individuals have access to life-saving vaccines regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location.\n48.

Active immunity can also be generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility.

Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed. Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use Scots, Gaelic, or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer. The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.\n\nImplications:\n"

Zhèng (Chinese: 正) meaning \"right\", \"just\", or \"true\", would have received the Mongolian adjectival modifier -s, creating \"Jenggis\", which in medieval romanization would be written \"Genghis\".

It is possible that the Mongols used the term \"Jenggis\" as an adjectival modifier for the concept of \"just\" or \"true\".\n6. During the 13th century, the Mongolian pronunciation of the name \"Genghis Khan\" may have resembled \"Chinggis\".\n7. The name \"Genghis Khan\" may have originated from the Mongolian word \"Jenggis\", which was derived from the Turkic and Mongolian word \"tenggis\".\n8. Tenggis has a meaning that suggests wide-spreading or oceanic in nature.\n9. Lake Baikal and the ocean were known by the Mongols as \"tenggis\".\n10. It is likely that the term \"Chinggis\" was used by the Mongols to refer to \"Jenggis\", but this is a possibility that needs further research to confirm.\n11. The use of the term \"Chinggis\" in the passage suggests that the author was either unaware of the origin of the name or was using it as an alternative spelling.\n12.

The passage provides information on the possible origin and meaning of the name \"Genghis Khan\", but further research may be needed to confirm the accuracy of this information.\n17. The name \"Genghis Khan\" may have had different connotations or meanings to the Mongols than it does to modern-day audiences.\n18. The use of the term \"Chinggis\" may have been a product of linguistic evolution and the natural changes that occur in language over time.\n19. The name \"Genghis Khan\" may have been a reflection of the Mongols' connection to the ocean and their understanding of the world around them.\n20.

(Lake Baikal and ocean were called tenggis by the Mongols. However, it seems that if they had meant to call Genghis tenggis they could have said, and written, \"Tenggis Khan\", which they did not.) Zhèng (Chinese: 正) meaning \"right\", \"just\", or \"true\", would have received the Mongolian adjectival modifier -s, creating \"Jenggis\", which in medieval romanization would be written \"Genghis\". It is likely that the 13th century Mongolian pronunciation would have closely matched \"Chinggis\".\n\nImplications:\n"

The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.",

Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement.

The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]\n\nImplications:\n"

The group had nominal control over small areas of Libya, Nigeria, and Afghanistan in addition to its territories in Iraq and Syria.\n6. The Islamic State is considered a Wahhabi/Salafi jihadist extremist group, which focuses on strict interpretation and adherence to Islamic law and is known for its violent tactics.\n7. The group has operated or has affiliates in other parts of the world, including North Africa and South Asia.\n8. Despite claiming to be a state, the Islamic State lacks international recognition and is widely considered to be an extremist organization.\n9. The group's control over large territories in Iraq and Syria has led to significant humanitarian crises, displacement of millions of people, and ongoing conflict with the local population and other groups in the region.\n10. The Islamic State's caliphate declaration has been widely criticized by the international community, with many governments, organizations, and individuals calling for its dismantlement and the restoration of peace and stability in the affected regions.\n11. The Islamic State's control over territory has allowed it to engage in a range of violent activities, including mass executions, torture, and persecution of minorities, such as Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims.\n12. The group's use of social media and the internet to spread its ideology and recruit new members has made it difficult to track and monitor its activities, complicating efforts to counter its influence.\n13. The Islamic State's claim to religious, political, and military authority over all Muslims has led to increased tensions within the global Muslim community, with some Muslims rejecting the group's extreme interpretations of Islam and efforts to establish a caliphate.\n14. The group's presence in multiple countries has led to increased cooperation and coordination among international security forces, but has also strained relations between different nations and governments.\n15. The Islamic State's control over significant amounts of oil and other natural resources in the territories it controls has allowed it to fund its operations and activities, further complicating efforts to counter its influence and destabilize the region.\n16. The group's control over territory and resources has made it a target for multiple military interventions by governments and international organizations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and others.\n17. The ongoing conflict in the region has led to significant humanitarian crises, with millions of people displaced, lacking access to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter, and subject to violence and abuse by various armed groups.\n18. The rise of the Islamic State has been linked to broader geopolitical tensions and conflicts in the region, including the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Syria, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and other disputes over resources and territory.\n19. The Islamic State's ideological appeal and use of violence have also inspired a number of other extremist groups and individuals, leading to increased instability and violence in other parts of the world.\n20. The group's control over territory and resources has also raised concerns about the potential spread of extremist ideologies and radicalization of vulnerable populations in the affected regions and beyond.",

Luther's translation of the Bible was not without its critics, and some argued that it deviated from the original text of the Bible.\n18. The translation of the Bible into German was part of a broader trend towards greater accessibility and understanding of scripture in the early modern period.\n19. Luther's translation of the Bible helped to promote the idea that individuals could have a direct relationship with God, without the mediation of the clergy.\n20. The debate surrounding the insertion of the word \"alone\" in Luther's translation of the Bible highlights the importance of language and vocabulary in theological discussions.",

He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life. Others had translated the Bible into German, but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine. When he was criticised for inserting the word \"alone\" after \"faith\" in Romans 3:28, he replied in part: \"[T]he text itself and the meaning of St. Paul urgently require and demand it. For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine, namely, that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law. ...

          "text": "1. The French and Indian War was a conflict between France and British colonial forces.\n2. The passage describes the French effort to secure their claims in the Ohio Valley during the French and Indian War.\n3. Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force to protect French interests in the Ohio Valley.\n4. Marin's force consisted of Troupes de la Marine (French colonial troops) and Indians.\n5. The French planned to protect their land in the Ohio Valley from British encroachment.\n6. Marin's forces were not the first French presence in the Ohio Valley; Céloron had previously mapped out a route and buried lead plates to mark French claims.\n7. Marin constructed Fort Presque Isle on the south shore of Lake Erie as the first part of his effort to secure French claims in the Ohio Valley.\n8. Marin then followed a road that led to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek, where he constructed a second fort, Fort Le Boeuf, designed to guard this strategic location.\n9. The construction of Fort Le Boeuf signaled French presence and interest in the region to both the British and the Iroquois, who were also present in the area.\n10. The Iroquois, who had been driven west by colonial expansion, were now threatened by the French and responded with intense dislike, as demonstrated by Tanaghrisson, a chief of the Mingo tribe.\n11. Tanaghrisson was not only hostile towards the French but also saw them as a threat to the integrity of his tribe, as he accused the French of killing and eating his father.\n12. Tanaghrisson traveled to Fort Le Boeuf to confront the French directly and threatened military action against them.\n13. Marin, the French commander, was dismissive of Tanaghrisson's threat, suggesting that he did not take the Mingo chief seriously.\n14. The French and Indian War was a complex conflict involving multiple European powers and Native American tribes.\n15. The passage provides insight into the geopolitical tensions and rivalries of the time, as various groups vied for control of the Ohio Valley.\n16. The construction of Forts Presque Isle and Le Boeuf demonstrated French intentions to establish a presence in the region and secure their claims against potential British encroachment.\n17. The reactions of the Iroquois, particularly Tanaghrisson, highlight the fracturing of alliances and rivalries among Native American tribes, as they were increasingly caught up in the conflict between European powers.\n18. The French and Indian War marked a significant turning point in the history of North America, as it shifted the balance of power in the region and contributed to the eventual establishment of the United States.\n19. The French and Indian War was a conflict that involved not only French and British forces but also numerous Native American tribes, who were drawn into the conflict due to their own interests and alliances.\n20. The passage suggests that the French and Indian War was an ongoing struggle for control of the Ohio Valley, which had been the site of earlier conflicts, such as those involving Céloron and the French colonial troops.\n21. The construction of Forts Presque Isle and Le Boeuf was an attempt by the French to establish a stronger presence in the Ohio Valley and maintain their claim to the region.\n22. The response of Tanaghrisson, a Mingo chief, to the French construction of Fort Le Boeuf highlights the complex relationships between European colonial powers and Native American tribes, as well as the competing interests and alliances within the Native American community.\n23. The French and Indian War was a conflict that drew in a range of different groups, including colonial forces, native tribes, and even some British colonists, who may have been drawn into the conflict due to their own interests or alliances.\n24. The passage suggests that the French were not the only European power interested in the Ohio Valley, as British forces were also present in the region and may have been reacting to the French construction of forts.\n25. The French and Indian War was a conflict that spanned multiple years and involved numerous battles and skirmishes, as French and British forces competed for control of the Ohio Valley and other territories.\n26. The reactions of Tanaghrisson and other Native American leaders to the French presence in the Ohio Valley highlight the complex and often fraught relationships between European colonial powers and Native American tribes during this period.\n27. The construction of Forts Presque Isle and Le Boeuf by the French was an attempt to secure their claims in the Ohio Valley and defend against potential British encroachment.\n28. The French and Indian War was a conflict that had significant long-term consequences for the history of North America, including the eventual establishment of the United States.\n29. The passage suggests that the French and Indian War was not a simple conflict between two opposing sides, but rather a complex web of interactions and alliances involving multiple groups, each with their own interests and agendas.\n30. The French and Indian War was a conflict that involved not only military forces, but also political, economic, and social factors, as various groups vied for control of the Ohio Valley and other territories in the region.\n31. The passage highlights the challenges faced by the French and British in establishing and maintaining their presence in the Ohio Valley, as they had to contend with not only each other but also with Native American tribes, who often had their own interests and alliances.\n32. The reactions of Tanaghrisson and other Native American leaders to the French presence in the Ohio Valley demonstrate the complex and often fraught relationships between European colonial powers and Native American tribes during this period.\n33.

Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare and PharMerica). This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings.

This process is more common in C4 plants, which have higher energy needs.\n7. Cyclic photophosphorylation allows for more efficient energy production.\n8. The electron transport chains in chloroplasts play a role in generating ATP through the pumping of hydrogen ions.\n9. The thylakoid space is the location where these hydrogen ions are pumped.\n10. Cyclic photophosphorylation contributes to the overall efficiency of photosynthesis in plants.\n11. NADP+ is an essential molecule for reenergizing depleted electrons in photosystem I.\n12. The process of photosynthesis in plants involves multiple stages, including water photolysis and electron transport.\n13. Photosynthesis is a complex biological process that generates energy for plants.\n14. Cyclic photophosphorylation allows for the recycling of electrons within the electron transport chains.\n15. The availability of NADP+ is necessary for the completion of the electron transport chain.\n16. Cyclic photophosphorylation can be seen as a secondary process that supplements ATP production in plants.\n17. C4 plants have a higher demand for ATP than NADPH, making cyclic photophosphorylation more advantageous for them.\n18. The electron transport chain in chloroplasts involves the movement of electrons through a series of protein complexes.\n19. The energy released from the movement of electrons is used to pump hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane.\n20. This proton gradient is then used to generate ATP through a process called chemiosmosis.\n21. Cyclic photophosphorylation can occur in parallel with non-cyclic photophosphorylation, allowing for the generation of both ATP and NADPH.\n22. The efficiency of photosynthesis in plants can be influenced by the balance between cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation.\n23. The energy demands of different plant species can affect the relative importance of cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation.\n24. Cyclic photophosphorylation may play a role in the acclimation of plants to changing light conditions.\n25. The regulation of cyclic photophosphorylation may involve the activity of specific enzymes and proteins within the chloroplast.\n26. The efficiency of cyclic photophosphorylation can be affected by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and the availability of NADP+.\n27. Cyclic photophosphorylation may provide a source of ATP for other cellular processes in addition to photosynthesis.\n28. The study of cyclic photophosphorylation can provide insights into the mechanisms of energy generation and efficiency in photosynthetic organisms.\n29. Understanding the factors that regulate cyclic photophosphorylation may help in the development of strategies to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis in crops.\n30. The discovery of cyclic photophosphorylation highlights the complexity and adaptability of the photosynthetic process in plants.\n31. Cyclic photophosphorylation may have evolved as a way for plants to optimize their energy use under varying environmental conditions.\n32. The regulation of cyclic photophosphorylation may involve feedback loops that adjust the balance between ATP and NADPH production.\n33. The relative contributions of cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation may vary across different species of plants.\n34. Cyclic photophosphorylation may be more prevalent in plants that live in low-light environments, where efficient energy use is particularly important.\n35. The study of cyclic photophosphorylation may have implications for the development of synthetic biology and artificial photosynthesis systems.\n36. The efficiency of cyclic photophosphorylation may be influenced by the presence of other electron carriers within the electron transport chain.\n37. The regulation of cyclic photophosphorylation may involve the coordination of multiple signaling pathways within the chloroplast.\n38.

Normally, the reenergized electrons are taken by NADP+, though sometimes they can flow back down more H+-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP. This is termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are recycled. Cyclic photophosphorylation is common in C4 plants, which need more ATP than NADPH.\n\nImplications:\n"

The letters are strongly reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet.

His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after Cnut the Great's conquest of the isle.\n\nImplications:\n"

He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting Report, published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century.\n\nImplications:\n"

The immune system is more active during sleep, with a peak in differentiated effector cells like natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes.\n4. Anti-inflammatory molecules like cortisol and catecholamines reach their highest levels during wake periods to help regulate the immune response.\n5. There are two main theories explaining why inflammation predominantly occurs during sleep.\n6. The first theory suggests that a pro-inflammatory state during wake periods would have severe cognitive and physical consequences, potentially hindering daily functioning and productivity.\n7. The second theory proposes that the presence of melatonin during sleep is responsible for the pro-inflammatory state, as it may counteract free radical production and oxidative stress that inflammation would otherwise cause.\n8. Inflammation has detrimental effects on overall health, including cognitive impairments and physical limitations.\n9. Sleep is a critical time for the immune system to effectively respond to potential intruders, as it is during this time that inflammation is most prominent.\n10. The immune system's ability to effectively respond to pathogens is crucial for maintaining health and preventing illness.\n11. The presence of anti-inflammatory molecules like cortisol and catecholamines during wake periods helps regulate the immune response and prevent excessive inflammation.\n12. The timing of inflammation during sleep may be an evolutionary adaptation to ensure that the immune system can effectively respond to potential threats without interfering with daily life.\n13. Disruptions in sleep patterns or quality may negatively impact the immune system's ability to effectively respond to pathogens and increase the risk of illness.\n14. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between sleep, inflammation, and the immune system.\n15. Melatonin may play a role in modulating inflammation during sleep, potentially providing a target for future interventions to improve immune function.\n16. Chronic inflammation, if not regulated properly, can contribute to the development of various diseases and disorders, highlighting the importance of a healthy immune response.\n17. The immune system's response to inflammation during sleep may have implications for the effectiveness of immune-based therapies and interventions.\n18. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the pro-inflammatory state during sleep could inform the development of novel treatments for sleep-related disorders and inflammation-associated diseases.\n19. The immune system's dynamic response to inflammation during sleep may have implications for understanding the complex relationship between sleep, immunity, and overall health.\n20.

This World's Fair devoted a building to electrical exhibits. It was a key event in the history of AC power, as Westinghouse demonstrated the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system to the American public.

The oil crisis accelerated the search for alternative energy sources, such as renewable energy and nuclear power, to reduce dependence on oil.\n14. The oil crisis contributed to the shift in global power dynamics, with countries like the United States and Japan becoming more reliant on energy imports from OPEC countries.\n15. The oil crisis had a lasting impact on the global political landscape, with the United States and other Western countries seeking to reduce their dependence on OPEC oil and increase energy self-sufficiency.\n16. The oil crisis led to the formation of new international agreements and organizations, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), to coordinate energy policies and promote energy security.\n17. The oil crisis highlighted the importance of energy security and the need for countries to diversify their energy sources and reduce their dependence on oil.\n18. The oil crisis contributed to the rise of alternative forms of energy, such as natural gas and coal, as more affordable and accessible energy sources.\n19. The oil crisis led to increased investment in energy infrastructure, including pipelines, storage facilities, and transportation systems, to improve energy supply and reduce transportation costs.\n20. The oil crisis had a significant impact on the global trade balance, with oil-importing countries experiencing trade deficits and oil-exporting countries experiencing trade surpluses.\n21. The oil crisis led to the development of new energy technologies, such as shale gas and hydraulic fracturing, which increased the availability of affordable energy resources.\n22. The oil crisis highlighted the importance of energy efficiency and conservation, with individuals and businesses seeking to reduce their energy consumption and lower their energy bills.\n23. The oil crisis contributed to the rise of environmental concerns, with increased awareness of the environmental impact of oil production and consumption.\n24. The oil crisis led to the implementation of new environmental regulations and standards, such as emission standards and energy efficiency standards, to promote sustainable energy practices.\n25. The oil crisis contributed to the development of new international agreements and organizations, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to address climate change and promote sustainable energy practices.\n26. The oil crisis had a lasting impact on the global energy market, with OPEC remaining a significant player in the global oil market, while alternative energy sources and technologies continue to gain prominence.\n27. The oil crisis highlighted the importance of energy diplomacy and cooperation between countries, with increased dialogue and collaboration between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to promote energy security and stability.\n28. The oil crisis contributed to the rise of geopolitical tensions, with OPEC countries using their oil resources as leverage in international affairs.\n29. The oil crisis led to increased investment in research and development of alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind, and biofuels, to reduce dependence on oil and promote energy independence.\n30. The oil crisis contributed to the development of new financial instruments, such as oil derivatives and futures markets, to manage energy risk and promote energy market stability.",

OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions, so their real incomes lagged.

The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\". Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while within the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.\n\nImplications:\n"

First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin burst and the fire erupted onto the pad area, frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.\n\nImplications:\n"

The majority of studies on the topic focus on the relationship between inequality and homicides due to their universal and consistent definition across nations.\n3. There have been over fifty studies conducted on this topic, finding evidence for a positive relationship between inequality and violence.\n4. There are varying degrees of correlation between economic inequality and crime rates, depending on the comparison made (e.g., developed vs. undeveloped countries).\n5. Daly et al. (2001) found a tenfold difference in homicide rates across U.S. states and Canadian provinces, related to inequality.\n6. About half of the variation in homicide rates can be explained by differences in inequality levels in each province or state, according to Daly et al. (2001).\n7. Fajnzylber et al. (2002) found a similar relationship between inequality and homicides worldwide.\n8. Academic literature acknowledges the relationship between homicides and inequality, although it may not be universally consistent across all countries or regions.\n9. Economic inequality may contribute to an increase in crime rates, as higher levels of inequality are associated with more frequent instances of violence.\n10. The relationship between inequality and violence suggests that addressing economic disparities could potentially lead to a decrease in crime rates.\n11. The findings of these studies could inform policy decisions aimed at reducing economic inequality, as it may have positive effects on reducing crime rates.\n12. Further research is needed to investigate the specific mechanisms underlying the relationship between inequality and violence, as well as to identify potential policy interventions that can effectively address this issue.\n13. While the correlation between inequality and violence is evident, the causative factors and the direction of the relationship require further investigation.\n14. It is important to consider the cultural, social, and economic context of each country or region when interpreting the relationship between inequality and violence.\n15. The findings of these studies emphasize the need for comprehensive approaches to addressing economic inequality, as it may have far-reaching consequences for public safety and social stability.\n16. The presence of high levels of economic inequality in a society may create conditions that foster criminal behavior and violence.\n17. Addressing the root causes of economic inequality, such as inadequate education, job opportunities, and social support systems, may help reduce crime rates.\n18. Policies aimed at promoting social mobility and reducing income disparities could contribute to lowering crime rates and improving overall societal well-being.\n19. The relationship between inequality and violence highlights the interconnectedness of social, economic, and political factors in determining the safety and stability of a society.\n20. The findings of these studies have implications for public health, as they suggest that economic inequality may be a significant risk factor for poor health outcomes and social unrest.\n21. The evidence supports the idea that reducing economic inequality can have positive effects on various aspects of society, including public safety and overall quality of life.\n22. Policymakers should consider the potential impact of economic inequality on crime rates when designing and implementing social welfare policies.\n23. A multidisciplinary approach, involving experts from various fields such as economics, sociology, and criminology, may be necessary to fully understand the complex relationship between economic inequality and violence.\n24. The correlation between inequality and violence should prompt a reevaluation of current economic policies and their potential impact on public safety.\n25. These findings highlight the importance of promoting social justice and equitable resource distribution as essential components of a stable and peaceful society.\n26. The relationship between inequality and violence underscores the need for greater investment in education, healthcare, and social services to address the underlying causes of poverty and social exclusion.\n27. The evidence suggests that addressing income inequality could have a cascading positive effect on various aspects of societal well-being, including reduced crime rates and improved public health outcomes.\n28. The findings of these studies may also have implications for international development and aid programs, as they suggest that addressing economic inequality could be a critical component of promoting stability and prosperity in developing countries.\n29. The relationship between inequality and violence should prompt a reassessment of the concept of \"sustainable development,\" considering that economic inequality may undermine the achievement of long-term social and environmental goals.\n30. Policymakers should consider the potential long-term costs of failing to address economic inequality, including increased crime rates, social unrest, and reduced economic growth.",

First, the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther, whom Leo then summoned to Rome. The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet was held. There, in October 1518, under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist. The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy. The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than his writing the 95 Theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope. Cajetan's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant, but the legate desisted from doing so. Luther slipped out of the city at night, unbeknownst to Cajetan.\n\nImplications:\n"

Rev. Jimmy Creech was defrocked after a highly publicized church trial in 1999 on account of his participation in same-sex union ceremonies. It forbids any United Methodist board, agency, committee, commission, or council to give United Methodist funds to any gay organization or group, or otherwise use such funds to promote the acceptance of homosexuality. Other ministers have been defrocked for officiating at same-sex weddings and several trials of others are scheduled. Still, some congregations have sought other ways to recognize same-sex couples. For example, one congregation hosted a proposal for a same-sex couple announcing their engagement. Moreover, some churches, especially in 2016 after same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide, have provided blessings for same-sex marriages. In April of 2016, a United Methodist bishop made a bold statement by performing a same-sex marriage in church as a clear sign of his advocacy for change.\n\nImplications:\n"

      "context": "While the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"",

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"\n\nImplications:\n"

          "text": "1. The United Methodist Church has a rich history spanning over 220 years.\n2. Methodism in the United States has experienced divisions and mergers since its establishment in 1784.\n3. One of the early divisions occurred in 1830, with the creation of the Methodist Protestant Church, which separated from the Methodist Episcopal Church due to disagreements regarding lay involvement in church administration.\n4. The Methodist Protestant Church's main concern was ensuring that laity had a voice and vote in the management of the church.\n5. In contrast, the Methodist Episcopal Church maintained that clergy should be the primary decision-makers in the denomination's operations.\n6. The tensions surrounding the issue of laity's role in the church administration led to the creation of a separate denomination.\n7. The Methodist Episcopal Church continued to operate under the existing structure, with bishops holding significant power in determining the church's direction.\n8. Another significant division occurred in 1844, with the Methodist Episcopal Church splitting into two conferences.\n9. This split was influenced by debates regarding slavery and the authority of bishops within the denomination.\n10. The issues surrounding slavery and the role of bishops in the church administration were considered critical factors in the decision to divide the Methodist Episcopal Church.\n11. The division in 1844 resulted in two separate Methodist denominations operating within the United States.\n12. The Methodist Episcopal Church (North) was established, which opposed slavery and retained the hierarchical structure with bishops holding significant authority.\n13. The Methodist Episcopal Church (South) was also formed, which supported slavery and continued to emphasize the importance of the clergy's role in church governance.\n14. The establishment of two separate Methodist denominations contributed to the diverse religious landscape in the United States.\n15. The division in 1844 also highlighted the growing tensions between different factions within the Methodist Episcopal Church, which would continue to influence the denomination's evolution over time.\n16. The split in 1844 demonstrated the challenges faced by Methodism in navigating complex social, political, and religious issues.\n17. The formation of the two separate denominations in 1844 laid the groundwork for future mergers and divisions within the Methodist tradition in the United States.\n18. The Methodist Episcopal Church (North) and (South) maintained separate identities and practices until the early 20th century.\n19. In the years following the division in 1844, Methodist denominations continued to evolve and adapt to changing societal and religious contexts.\n20. Various Methodist bodies eventually merged, including the Methodist Episcopal Church, Methodist Episcopal Church, South, Methodist Protestant Church, and The Methodist Church, in the 20th century.\n21. In 1939, the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the Methodist Protestant Church merged to form The Methodist Church, also known as the Methodist Church (North).\n22. In 1968, The Methodist Church (North) merged with The Methodist Church (South) to form the United Methodist Church.\n23. The merger of The Methodist Church (North) and (South) represented a significant step toward reunification and a more united Methodist presence in the United States.\n24. The United Methodist Church's establishment in 1968 reflected the desire for greater unity and cooperation among Methodists in the country.\n25. The United Methodist Church, formed in 1968, is the largest Methodist denomination in the United States.\n26. The merger of The Methodist Church (North) and (South) in 1968 also resolved the longstanding tensions and divisions that had existed since the 1844 split.\n27. The United Methodist Church's current structure and practices reflect the diverse backgrounds and traditions of the various Methodist bodies that merged to form the denomination.\n28. The merger of The Methodist Church (North) and (South) created a larger, more inclusive denomination with a broader geographic reach.\n29. The United Methodist Church's current membership is diverse, encompassing a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.\n30. The merger of The Methodist Church (North) and (South) also contributed to the church's emphasis on social justice, inclusivity, and diversity in its mission and ministry.",

ABC's programming is syndicated in many countries, but the network itself is not broadcast internationally.\n4. ABC's decision to fully own its international networks was renewed in 2004 with the launch of ABC1 in the United Kingdom.\n5. The ABC Group's ownership of ABC1 lasted for three years before Disney announced its discontinuation in 2007.\n6. ABC1's failure to attain sustainable viewership led to Disney's decision to discontinue its international expansion efforts in 2007.\n7. ABC's failure to expand internationally may indicate a lack of interest or demand for its programming in other countries.\n8. The failure of ABC1 may have also been due to poor marketing or broadcasting strategies.\n9. ABC's decision to focus solely on domestic programming may be a result of a shift in market demand or changes in the media industry.\n10. ABC's failure to expand internationally may have impacted its overall profitability and market share.\n11. ABC's lack of international expansion may have limited its ability to diversify its revenue streams.\n12. The discontinuation of ABC1 may have had an impact on the careers of employees who worked on the channel or were hired specifically for its launch.\n13. The decision to discontinue ABC1 may have been seen as a cost-cutting measure by Disney, reducing the company's financial burden.\n14. The lack of success of ABC1 may have discouraged other cable networks from pursuing similar international expansion strategies.\n15. ABC's decision to discontinue ABC1 may have had an impact on the development of future international programming ventures.\n16. The failure of ABC1 may have been due to a lack of cultural relevance or understanding in the United Kingdom.\n17. ABC's failure to expand internationally may have been a missed opportunity to diversify its audience and programming.\n18. The decision to discontinue ABC1 may have had an impact on the international reputation of the ABC brand.\n19. ABC's focus on domestic programming may have limited the creativity and innovation of its programming.\n20. The discontinuation of ABC1 may have had an impact on the development of new programming for the network.\n21. ABC's decision to discontinue ABC1 may have been influenced by competition from other international networks and streaming services.\n22. The failure of ABC1 may have been due to a lack of investment in the channel's infrastructure and resources.\n23. ABC's decision to discontinue ABC1 may have been due to a lack of interest or demand for traditional linear television in the United Kingdom.\n24. The discontinuation of ABC1 may have led to a shift towards more digital and online programming for ABC.\n25. The failure of ABC1 may have been due to a lack of effective partnerships with other media companies in the United Kingdom.\n26. ABC's decision to discontinue ABC1 may have been due to changes in the regulatory environment for media in the United Kingdom.\n27. The failure of ABC1 may have been due to a lack of innovation or adaptation to changing viewer habits and preferences.\n28.

Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions. In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box, limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+HD Box as standard, thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+. In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box, offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality.

The logo from 1973–80 was used for the Third Doctor's final season and for the majority of the Fourth Doctor's tenure. The following logo, while most associated with the Fifth Doctor, was also used for the Fourth Doctor's final season. The logo used for the Ninth Doctor was slightly edited for the Tenth Doctor, but it retained the same general appearance. The logo used for the Eleventh Doctor had the \"DW\" TARDIS insignia placed to the right in 2012, but the same font remained, albeit with a slight edit to the texture every episode, with the texture relating to some aspect of the story. The logo for the Twelfth Doctor had the \"DW\" TARDIS insignia removed and the font was subtly altered, as well as made slightly larger. As of 2014, the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors is the primary logo used on all media and merchandise relating to past Doctors, and the current Doctor Who logo is used for all merchandise relating to the current Doctor.\n\nImplications:\n"

In 1656, the plague killed about half of Naples' 300,000 inhabitants. More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain. The plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of Seville by half. In 1709–13, a plague epidemic that followed the Great Northern War (1700–21, Sweden v. Russia and allies) killed about 100,000 in Sweden, and 300,000 in Prussia. The plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of Helsinki, and claimed a third of Stockholm's population.

For mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors. However, most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant, so that indirectly the world's industry is still dependent on steam power. Recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover. This is becoming known as the Advanced Steam movement.[citation needed]\n\nImplications:\n"

The university partially manages Argonne National Laboratory, part of the United States Department of Energy's national laboratory system, and has a joint stake in Fermilab, a nearby particle physics laboratory, as well as a stake in the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico. Faculty and students at the adjacent Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago collaborate with the university, In 2013, the university announced that it was affiliating the formerly independent Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. Although formally unrelated, the National Opinion Research Center is located on Chicago's campus.\n\nImplications:\n"

The French presence in the Ohio territory threatened the economic interests of the Ohio Company and its investors.\n4.

The warning sent by Washington could potentially open the door for further negotiations or attempts at diplomacy between the French and the Ohio Company.\n16. The fact that Washington was able to complete his mission despite facing potential bias from the Virginia government (his employer) highlights the dedication and resourcefulness of early American military leaders.\n17.

Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies—it only borrows them.

Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers. Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called \"Right Alan Guard\" which was combined with \"recently surrendered\" soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi (Ch'i Kung-chih). After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them.

Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime.

          "text": "1. Prime numbers play a crucial role in modern cryptography, particularly in public-key cryptography systems like RSA.\n2. Prime numbers are the building blocks of integers, and their study is fundamental to number theory and arithmetic.\n3. Modern primality tests have made it possible to efficiently determine whether a large number is prime or composite.\n4. Probabilistic primality tests, such as the Miller-Rabin test, are faster than deterministic algorithms, but they have a small chance of producing a false positive.\n5. Deterministic primality tests, such as the AKS primality test, can prove with certainty whether a number is prime or composite, but they are often slower than probabilistic tests.\n6. The distribution of prime numbers is not fully understood, and there are still many unsolved problems related to their properties and patterns.\n7. The study of prime numbers has led to the development of many other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, and algebraic geometry.\n8. Prime numbers have important applications in computer science, such as in the generation of random numbers, error-correcting codes, and the design of efficient algorithms.\n9. The search for large prime numbers, often carried out by distributed computing projects like the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, has led to the discovery of many new large primes and contributed to the understanding of their properties.\n10. The study of prime numbers has a long history, dating back to the ancient Greeks, and has been pursued by mathematicians for centuries.\n11. The Riemann hypothesis, one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, is related to the distribution of prime numbers.\n12. The prime number theorem gives an asymptotic estimate for the number of prime numbers less than a given value, but it does not provide a precise formula for the nth prime number.\n13. The Goldbach conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, remains unproven but has been verified for all even numbers up to very large values.\n14. The twin prime conjecture, which states that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2, is also unproven but has been supported by numerical evidence.\n15. The concept of prime numbers has been generalized to other algebraic structures, such as polynomials over finite fields and algebraic integers.\n16. The study of prime numbers has led to the development of new mathematical techniques and concepts, such as the theory of modular forms, the Langlands program, and the Lang-Trotter conjecture.\n17. The distribution of prime numbers is closely related to the distribution of zeros of the Riemann zeta function, which is a central object in analytic number theory.\n18. The study of prime numbers has applications in physics, such as in the study of quantum chaos and the distribution of energy levels in quantum systems.\n19. The study of prime numbers has applications in computer security, such as in the design of secure communication protocols and the generation of cryptographic keys.\n20. The study of prime numbers has applications in biology, such as in the study of the distribution of species and the evolution of complex systems.",

          "text": "1. Lepidodinium viride and its close relatives are a group of dinophytes that have undergone a unique evolutionary event involving the replacement of their original chloroplast.\n2. The chloroplast that Lepidodinium viride possesses is not of the peridinin type, which is common among dinophytes, but rather it is a green algal-derived chloroplast, more specifically a prasinophyte.\n3. The green algal-derived chloroplast in Lepidodinium is the only known example of such a chloroplast in a dinophyte, making it a unique case of endosymbiotic event.\n4. The chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride is surrounded by two membranes, indicating that it is a plastid with a fully enclosed membrane system.\n5. The chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride lacks a nucleomorph, which is a small, non-circular DNA-containing organelle that is typically found in secondary or tertiary endosymbionts.\n6. The transfer of all nucleomorph genes from the chloroplast to the dinophyte nucleus has likely occurred over time, as a result of the endosymbiotic event and subsequent evolution of the organism.\n7. The endosymbiotic event that led to the acquisition of the green algal-derived chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride was a result of a complex evolutionary process involving multiple secondary endosymbioses, rather than a single tertiary endosymbiosis.\n8. The green algal-derived chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride contains a primary chloroplast, which suggests that the original green alga likely had a photosynthetic capacity before becoming an endosymbiont.\n9. The acquisition of a green algal-derived chloroplast by Lepidodinium viride is an example of a secondary or tertiary endosymbiotic event, where a eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthetic eukaryotic cell and maintained its chloroplast as an organelle.\n10. The fact that the chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride is not of the rhodoplast lineage suggests that it may have undergone a different evolutionary path compared to other dinophytes that have retained their original peridinin chloroplast.\n11. The chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride likely plays a critical role in the photosynthetic capacity of the organism, allowing it to perform photosynthesis and contribute to its energy requirements.\n12. The unique chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride may provide insights into the mechanisms of endosymbiotic events and the evolution of plastids in eukaryotic organisms.\n13. The lack of a nucleomorph in the chloroplast of Lepidodinium viride suggests that it has undergone significant genetic transfers between the chloroplast and the dinophyte nucleus, leading to the loss of the nucleomorph.\n14. The endosymbiotic event that resulted in the acquisition of the green algal-derived chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride may have occurred relatively recently in the evolutionary history of the organism, as the chloroplast appears to have maintained its functional integrity over time.\n15. The presence of the green algal-derived chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride may have impacted the evolutionary relationships and classification of the organism within the dinophyte phylum.\n16. The unique chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride may have implications for our understanding of the diversity and complexity of endosymbiotic events in the evolution of eukaryotic organisms.\n17. The acquisition of a green algal-derived chloroplast by Lepidodinium viride may have allowed the organism to adapt to different environmental conditions and resources, providing a competitive advantage in its ecosystem.\n18. The presence of the green algal-derived chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride may have influenced the ecological niche and interactions of the organism with other species in its environment.\n19. The endosymbiotic event that led to the acquisition of the green algal-derived chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride may have had implications for the evolution of other dinophytes, as they may have been exposed to similar endosymbiotic opportunities.\n20. The unique chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride may have implications for the study of plastid evolution, particularly in regards to the transfer of genetic material between the chloroplast and the dinophyte nucleus.\n21. The chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride may serve as a model system for studying the mechanisms of endosymbiosis and the maintenance of functional plastids in eukaryotic organisms.\n22. The loss of the nucleomorph in the chloroplast of Lepidodinium viride may have implications for our understanding of the genetic organization and regulation within plastids.\n23. The green algal-derived chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride may have retained some unique features of its original algal host, such as specific photosynthetic pigments or protein structures, which could provide insights into the diversity of photosynthetic systems in eukaryotes.\n24. The acquisition of a green algal-derived chloroplast by Lepidodinium viride may have allowed the organism to exploit different light wavelengths or resource availability, potentially expanding its ecological niche.\n25. The unique chloroplast in Lepidodinium viride may have implications for the study of photosynthetic efficiency and the evolution of photosynthetic strategies in eukaryotic organisms.",

Lepidodinium is the only dinophyte that has a chloroplast that's not from the rhodoplast lineage. The chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and has no nucleomorph—all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred to the dinophyte nucleus. The endosymbiotic event that led to this chloroplast was serial secondary endosymbiosis rather than tertiary endosymbiosis—the endosymbiont was a green alga containing a primary chloroplast (making a secondary chloroplast).\n\nImplications:\n"

But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled the ball during the return, but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession.\n\nImplications:\n"

Lamas play a significant role in the religious and spiritual life of Tibetan Buddhism.\n4. Lamas are responsible for teaching and guiding individuals on the path to enlightenment.\n5. The goal of Tibetan Buddhism is to achieve enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of rebirth.\n6. The concept of a Tulku is unique to Tibetan Buddhism.\n7. A Tulku is a Lama who has consciously determined to be reborn multiple times in order to continue their Bodhisattva vow.\n8. The Bodhisattva vow is a commitment to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n9. A Tulku's reincarnation is part of their commitment to the Bodhisattva vow.\n10. Tulku's are considered to be incarnations of Bodhisattvas and are highly revered in Tibetan Buddhism.\n11. The process of determining a Tulku's rebirth involves phowa and siddhi, which are advanced practices in Tibetan Buddhism.\n12. Phowa is a technique used to transfer one's consciousness to a specific place or being after death.\n13. Siddhi refers to special powers or abilities that a practitioner may develop through meditation and practice.\n14. Tulku's are often recognized through signs, visions, or other supernatural phenomena.\n15. Recognizing a Tulku can be a lengthy and complex process, involving multiple individuals and institutions.\n16. Tulku's are often recognized by other Lamas or senior spiritual figures within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\n17. Tulku's may receive special training and education to prepare them for their role as a spiritual leader.\n18. The recognition of a Tulku can have significant political and social implications within the Tibetan Buddhist community.\n19. Tulku's may be seen as representatives of their lineage or as embodiments of specific deities or Buddhas.\n20. The reincarnation of a Tulku is often considered to be a continuation of their spiritual work and teachings.\n21. Tulku's are often seen as living Buddhas or highly accomplished practitioners of Buddhism.\n22. The role of a Tulku in Tibetan Buddhism is similar to that of a guru or spiritual teacher in other religious traditions.\n23. Tulku's may establish monasteries, conduct retreats, and teach others on the path to enlightenment.\n24. Tulku's may also engage in social and political activism to promote peace, compassion, and social justice.\n25. The recognition of a Tulku can be a source of pride and cultural identity for the Tibetan people.\n26. Tulku's may serve as spiritual guides for both Tibetan and non-Tibetan practitioners of Buddhism.\n27. The concept of a Tulku challenges traditional notions of death and rebirth, emphasizing the continuity of the spiritual journey.\n28. Tulku's may offer unique insights into the nature of existence and the path to enlightenment.\n29. The recognition of a Tulku can have economic implications, as the institution associated with a Tulku may generate income and support through offerings and donations.\n30. The concept of a Tulku raises questions about the nature of identity, continuity, and the self in the context of reincarnation.\n31. Tulku's may inspire and motivate individuals to pursue spiritual practices and aspire to higher levels of consciousness.\n32. The recognition of a Tulku can be a source of hope and inspiration for those seeking spiritual guidance and support.\n33. Tulku's may serve as role models for individuals seeking to integrate spirituality into their daily lives.\n34. The concept of a Tulku challenges traditional notions of mortality and encourages a more optimistic and forward-looking perspective on life.\n35. Tulku's may play a crucial role in the preservation and transmission of Tibetan Buddhist teachings and traditions.\n36. The recognition of a Tulku can be a source of continuity and stability for the Tibetan Buddhist community, providing a sense of connection to the past and future.\n37. Tulku's may serve as agents of cultural exchange, sharing their knowledge and practices with individuals from diverse backgrounds.\n38. The concept of a Tulku can be seen as a manifestation of the interconnectedness of all beings and the continuity of the spiritual journey.\n39. Tulku's may offer a unique perspective on the nature of reality and the ultimate goal of spiritual practice.\n40. The recognition of a Tulku can be a source of unity and harmony within the Tibetan Buddhist community, promoting cooperation and mutual support.",

The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed. In the region of the Xingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.\n\nImplications:\n"
