Under his leadership, the Mongol tribes, which had shared cultural similarities but lacked a unified identity, came together as a single political and ethnic group. He played a crucial role in establishing a stable and unified Mongolian nation during a period of constant tribal warfare. In addition to this, Genghis Khan is credited with introducing the traditional Mongolian script and creating the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. According to Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, Genghis Khan's introduction of the \"Ikh Zasag law\" helped to heavily punish corruption and bribery, emphasizing the importance of equality under the law for all citizens, regardless of their status or wealth. President Elbegdorj draws inspiration from Genghis Khan's approach to anti-corruption efforts, as the legendary leader understood that true justice begins and is reinforced by the equality of law, rather than by distinctions between people. In his speech marking the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khan's birth, President Elbegdorj highlighted Genghis Khan's deep realization that good laws and rules endure longer than mere fancy palaces.

While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is external in most species, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up to a thousand times as many) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position to be used in the dark reactions.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]",

Some hypotheses suggest that it may have been a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues, using a reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time. Another theory proposes that the term may have come from the Dutch word \"Huisgenoten\" (housemates), which has a similar connotation to the German word \"Eidgenosse\" (Confederates). This would align with the fact that Geneva, where John Calvin lived and established the Calvinist movement, was a city-state that had close ties with the Swiss Confederation. The term \"Huguenot\" is believed to have been first applied to those aristocratic members of the Reformed Church who were involved in the Amboise Plot of 1560, a failed attempt to gain power in France from the House of Guise. The plot would have also strengthened relations between France and the Swiss Confederation. Therefore, the nickname \"Huguenot\" is thought to be a combination of Hugues and Eidgenosse, or \"housemates,\" which in turn led to the term we know today.\n* The term \"Huguenot\" has a complex history and its origins are not entirely clear. One possible explanation is that it was a derogatory nickname combining the name of the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) with the Dutch word \"Huisgenoten\" (housemates), which has a similar meaning to the German word \"Eidgenosse\" (Confederates). This connection is significant because Geneva, the city where John Calvin established the Calvinist movement, was a part of the Swiss Confederation. The Huguenot label was allegedly first used in France to refer to the Protestant conspirators involved in the Amboise Plot of 1560, a plot that aimed to seize power from the House of Guise. This plot would have had the added benefit of strengthening ties between France and the Swiss Confederation. Therefore, the term \"Huguenot\" may have emerged as a way to associate the Protestant cause with a political movement that was seen as unappealing in France.\n* The term \"Huguenot\" has an ambiguous history and its origins remain uncertain. Some theories propose that the nickname may have been a clever play on the name Hugues, referencing the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the contentious nature of Swiss republicanism at the time. Another hypothesis suggests that the term may have originated from the Dutch word \"Huisgenoten\" (housemates), which shares a similar meaning to the German word \"Eidgenosse\" (Confederates). This connection is relevant because Geneva, the city where John Calvin established the Calvinist movement, was a member of the Swiss Confederation. The Huguenot label is believed to have been first applied to the Protestant conspirators involved in the Amboise Plot of 1560, a plot that aimed to take power from the House of Guise. This plot would have also served to bolster relations between France and the Swiss Confederation. Consequently, the nickname \"Huguenot\" is thought to have evolved from a combination of Hugues and Eidgenosse, or \"housemates,\" ultimately giving rise to the term we know today.",

Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Initially, John Dalton's atomic hypothesis stated that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would have the simplest atomic ratios. He believed that water's formula was HO, which resulted in him assuming that the atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of around 16. In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt revealed that water is composed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen.

According to John Dalton's original atomic hypothesis, all elements were considered to be made up of single atoms, and the atoms in compounds had the simplest atomic ratios.

The logo's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate, which conferred a benefit for ABC (mostly before the advent of computer graphics).\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

United Methodist Church\n- John Wesley initially wished for the Methodists to remain within the Church of England, but the American Revolution led to their separation from the life and sacraments of the Anglican Church.

The conference was held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, considered the Mother Church of American Methodism.\n\n2. The Birth of the United Methodist Church\n- John Wesley's original intention was for the Methodists to stay within the Church of England, but the American Revolution ultimately led to their separation from the life and sacraments of the Anglican Church. In 1784, faced with the lack of a bishop from the Church of England to start a new church in the colonies, Wesley appointed Thomas Coke as a superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society. Alongside Coke, Wesley sent a revised Anglican Prayerbook and the Articles of Religion, which were embraced and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, marking the official establishment of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The conference took place at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, which is recognized as the Mother Church of American Methodism.\n\n3. The Formation of the United Methodist Church\n- Initially, John Wesley had hoped for the Methodists to remain part of the Church of England, but the American Revolution played a pivotal role in the Methodists' separation from the life and sacraments of the Anglican Church. In 1784, with the Church of England unable to send a bishop to establish a new church in the colonies, Wesley appointed Thomas Coke as a superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society. In collaboration with Coke, Wesley sent a revised version of the Anglican Prayerbook and the Articles of Religion, which were subsequently accepted and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784. This conference, held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, marked the official establishment of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which is regarded as the Mother Church of American Methodism.",

Joe Barton, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote joint letters with Ed Whitfield, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations demanding full records on climate research, as well as personal information about their finances and careers, from Mann, Bradley and Hughes. Sherwood Boehlert, chairman of the House Science Committee, said this was a \"misguided and illegitimate investigation\" apparently aimed at intimidating scientists, and at his request the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arranged for its National Research Council to set up a special investigation. The National Research Council's report agreed that there were some statistical failings, but these had little effect on the graph, which was generally correct. In a 2006 letter to Nature, Mann, Bradley, and Hughes pointed out that their original article had said that \"more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached\" and that the uncertainties were \"the point of the article\".\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

He was baptized as a Catholic the next morning on the feast day of St. Martin of Tours. His family moved to Mansfeld in 1484, where his father was a leaseholder of copper mines and smelters and served as one of four citizen representatives on the local council. The religious scholar Martin Marty describes Luther's mother as a hard-working woman of \"trading-class stock and middling means\" and notes that Luther's enemies later wrongly described her as a whore and bath attendant. He had several brothers and sisters, and is known to have been close to one of them, Jacob. Hans Luther was ambitious for himself and his family, and he was determined to see Martin, his eldest son, become a lawyer. He sent Martin to Latin schools in Mansfeld, then Magdeburg in 1497, where he attended a school operated by a lay group called the Brethren of the Common Life, and Eisenach in 1498. The three schools focused on the so-called \"trivium\": grammar, rhetoric, and logic. Luther later compared his education there to purgatory and hell.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

While experimenting with mechanical oscillators at his Houston Street lab, Tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings. As the speed grew, it is said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and, belatedly realizing the danger, he was forced to use a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment, just as the police arrived.:162–164 In February 1912, an article—\"Nikola Tesla, Dreamer\" by Allan L. Benson—was published in World Today, in which an artist's illustration appears showing the entire earth cracking in half with the caption, \"Tesla claims that in a few weeks he could set the earth's crust into such a state of vibration that it would rise and fall hundreds of feet and practically destroy civilization.

The empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, but it dissolved in the aftermath of World War I, leading to the emergence of the new state of Turkey in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, as well as the creation of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states, thus ending Turkish colonial ambitions.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68 °F). Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The chloroplasts within plant and algal cells have the remarkable ability to adapt their orientation in response to varying light conditions.

Conversely, during intense light conditions, they arrange themselves in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or rotate to face the light sideways, thereby shielding themselves from potential photooxidative damage. This strategic movement of chloroplasts, which allows them to seek shelter behind each other or spread out, is believed to be a key factor in the evolution of numerous small chloroplasts rather than a few larger ones. Chloroplast movement is recognized as one of the most finely tuned stimulus-response systems observed in plants.\n\n3. In conditions of low light, chloroplasts in plant and algal cells tend to spread out in a sheet-like manner, maximizing their surface area to capture as much light as possible.

In 1844, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church split into two conferences because of tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show, as well as the differing approach to the role that each brings, under the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation. The show's premise is that this is a life process of Time Lords through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and, to some extent, new personality, which occurs after sustaining an injury which would be fatal to most other species. Each actor's portrayal differs, but they are all intended to be aspects of the same character and form part of the same storyline. The time-travelling nature of the plot means that, on occasion, different Doctors have met each other.

Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation. Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law. Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.[citation needed]",

Unfortunately, early valves were frequently tampered with by engine drivers, leading to numerous accidents that allowed for greater steam pressure and more power from the engine.

The operation of steam engines typically involves the use of two independent mechanisms to prevent the pressure within the boiler from exceeding safe levels. One of these mechanisms can be adjusted by the user, whereas the other serves as a fail-safe measure. Historically, safety valves were constructed using a basic lever system that controlled a plug valve positioned at the top of the boiler. At one end of the lever, a weight or spring was attached to restrain the valve against the force of the steam pressure. However, in the past, engine drivers would often manipulate these valves to allow for increased steam pressure and subsequently more power from the engine, resulting in numerous accidents. To address this issue, modern safety valve designs feature an adjustable spring-loaded valve that is secured in place, preventing operators from tampering with its adjustment unless a seal is illegally broken.

When the war began, he lost the funds from his European patents. He sold Wardenclyffe for $20,000 ($472,500 in today's money). In 1917, just as Boldt demolished the Wardenclyffe Tower to improve the land for real estate, Tesla was awarded the Edison Medal by AIEE.\n\n- **Formal**:\n  Prior to World War I, Nikola Tesla endeavored to secure investment from overseas sources. Following the outbreak of the war, Tesla suffered the loss of funding derived from his European patent portfolio. Ultimately, he sold Wardenclyffe for $20,000, equivalent to approximately $472,500 in today's currency. Concurrently, in 1917, as Boldt's demolition of the Wardenclyffe Tower aimed to enhance the property's potential for real estate development, Tesla was conferred the Edison Medal by AIEE, recognizing his contributions.\n\n- **Informal**:\n  Before World War I, Nikola Tesla tried to get investors from other countries. But when the war started, he lost the money he was getting from his patents in Europe. Then, he sold Wardenclyffe for $20,000, which is like $472,500 today. In 1917, just when Boldt was tearing down the Wardenclyffe Tower to make the land better for selling, Tesla got the top prize from AIEE called the Edison Medal.\n\n- **Academic**:\n  During the period preceding World War I, Nikola Tesla pursued investments from international sources. The commencement of the war resulted in the loss of funding obtained from his European patent holdings. Consequently, Tesla sold Wardenclyffe for $20,000, which is approximately $472,500 in contemporary terms. Simultaneously, in 1917, as Boldt's demolition of the Wardenclyffe Tower was intended to render the land more suitable for real estate purposes, Tesla was honored with the Edison Medal by AIEE, signifying his achievements.\n\n- **Reportorial**:\n  Nikola Tesla, prior to World War I, attempted to garner investments from overseas. Following the onset of the war, Tesla lost the financial support he received from his European patents. Eventually, he sold Wardenclyffe for $20,000, equivalent to about $472,500 in today's dollars.

He came back to Lahore in 1908. While dividing his time between law practice and philosophical poetry, Iqbal had remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in World War I and remained in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as Muhammad Ali Johar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a critic of the mainstream Indian nationalist and secularist Indian National Congress. Iqbal's seven English lectures were published by Oxford University press in 1934 in a book titled The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion as well as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

The first shows the entire time from the formation of the Earth to the present, but this compresses the most recent eon. Therefore, the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale. The second scale compresses the most recent era, so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale. Since the Quaternary is a very short period with short epochs, it is further expanded in the fourth scale. The second, third, and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks. The Holocene (the latest epoch) is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right, another reason for expanding the fourth scale. The Pleistocene (P) epoch.

Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel.\n\n* **Simplified**\nThe first practical steam engine was invented by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. It improved upon earlier steam pumps by using a piston. Although not very efficient, this engine was used primarily for pumping water, such as from mines or to supply water for waterwheels at factories far from a water source. After the waterwheel, the excess water was pumped back into a higher reservoir.\n\n* **Formal**\nThe inaugural commercially viable steam engine, which was capable of generating power and transmitting it to machinery, was the atmospheric engine, conceived by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. This innovation represented an enhancement over the previously existing Savery's steam pump, incorporating a piston mechanism as suggested by Papin. Despite its relative inefficiency, Newcomen's engine found widespread use in applications such as draining deep mine shafts and supplying a consistent water supply for powering waterwheels located in factories situated away from a suitable \"head\" of water. Following the operation of the waterwheel, the remaining water was subsequently pumped back into an elevated storage reservoir.\n\n* **Informal**\nThomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine, developed around 1712, marked the first commercially successful steam engine. This invention built upon Savery's steam pump by introducing a piston design inspired by Papin. While not highly efficient, the engine was predominantly employed for pumping water, including tasks like draining deep mine workings and supplying water to waterwheels situated at factories removed from a reliable water source. Following the use of the waterwheel, the surplus water was then pumped back into a storage reservoir positioned above the wheel.\n\n* **Technical**\nThe initial commercially successful true engine, designed to generate power and transmit it to a machine, was the atmospheric engine, invented by Thomas Newcomen circa 1712. This innovation superseded Savery's steam pump, incorporating a piston mechanism proposed by Papin. Although relatively inefficient, Newcomen's engine saw widespread application in pumping water, particularly for draining mine workings at great depths and providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories located away from a suitable \"head\" of water. Post-operation of the waterwheel, the excess water was pumped back into a storage reservoir situated above the wheel.\n\n* **Educational**\nIn the early 18th century, Thomas Newcomen introduced the first commercially successful steam engine, known as the atmospheric engine, which was created around 1712.

For instance, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, when performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms, on the other hand, are generally faster but do not conclusively prove that a number is prime. These algorithms rely on testing a given number in a partially random manner. For example, a particular test might consistently pass when applied to a prime number, but only pass with a probability of p when applied to a composite number.

In the modern era, primality tests for general numbers n can be classified into two main categories: probabilistic (Monte Carlo) and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms provide a way to ascertain with certainty whether a given number is prime or composite. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if executed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms, on the other hand, are typically faster, but do not provide a conclusive proof that a number is prime. These algorithms rely on testing a given number in a partially random fashion. For instance, a particular test might consistently pass when applied to a prime number, but only pass with a probability of p when applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and it passes every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)^n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, allowing us to be as sure as we like (although never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.\n3. The modern approach to determining the primality of a number n can be divided into two primary classes of algorithms: probabilistic (Monte Carlo) and deterministic. Deterministic algorithms offer a method to definitively determine whether a given number is prime or composite. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, when carried out correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms, on the other hand, are generally faster but do not conclusively prove that a number is prime. These algorithms rely on testing a given number in a partially random manner. For instance, a particular test might consistently pass when applied to a prime number, but only pass with a probability of p when applied to a composite number.

Lepidodinium is the only dinophyte that has a chloroplast that's not from the rhodoplast lineage. The chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and has no nucleomorph—all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred to the dinophyte nucleus. The endosymbiotic event that led to this chloroplast was serial secondary endosymbiosis rather than tertiary endosymbiosis—the endosymbiont was a green alga containing a primary chloroplast (making a secondary chloroplast).\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Oxygen bars are establishments, found in Japan, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal O\n2 exposure for a fee. Professional athletes, especially in American football, also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a \"boost\" in performance. The pharmacological effect is doubtful; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation. Available studies support a performance boost from enriched O\n2 mixtures only if they are breathed during aerobic exercise.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled the ball during the return, but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were short cut and groynes were built, to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

          "text": "- **Simple Explanation:**\n  The force between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them. A special number called Newton's Universal Gravitation Constant helps us understand how strong this force is.\n\n- **Scientific Format:**\n  According to Newton's Law of Gravitation, the force (F) between two spherical objects with masses M and m is given by the formula F = G * (M * m) / r^2, where G is Newton's Universal Gravitation Constant, and r is the distance between the centers of the two objects.\n\n- **Historical Context:**\n  Newton's Law of Gravitation describes how the force of gravity acts between two objects. It states that the force (F) is proportional to the product of their masses (M and m), inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between them, and multiplied by a dimensional constant known as Newton's Universal Gravitation Constant (G).\n\n- **Mathematical Formulation:**\n  Mathematically, Newton's Law of Gravitation can be expressed as F = G * (M * m) / r^2, where F represents the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, M and m are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\n- **Newton's Insight:**\n  Isaac Newton proposed that the same gravitational forces that govern the motion of objects on Earth also apply to celestial bodies in space. This insight led to his formulation of the law of universal gravitation, which relates the force of gravity between two objects to their masses and the distance between them, multiplied by a universal gravitational constant (G).\n\n- **Cavendish's Measurement:**\n  While Newton's law of gravity was established during his lifetime, the precise value of the gravitational constant (G) was not determined until Henry Cavendish's experiment in 1798, which used a torsion balance to measure G. This measurement allowed scientists to calculate the mass of the Earth using the equation derived from Newton's law of gravity.\n\n- **Gravitational Force Formula:**\n  The formula for the gravitational force (F) between two objects with masses M and m, separated by a distance r, is F = G * (M * m) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant. This equation demonstrates the inverse square relationship between the force of gravity and the distance between the objects.",

So, in a strict sense, a private school is an unaided independent school. For the purpose of this definition, only receipt of financial aid is considered, not land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate. It is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution. The practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector. Among other things, this has also resulted in 30 different Examination Boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates. Prominent Examination Boards that are present in multiple states are the CBSE and the CISCE, NENBSE\n\nRewritten passages:\n"
