Treaties and Regulations have direct effect, meaning they are immediately applicable and do not require further legislative action by the member states.\n3. Directives, on the other hand, do not generally give citizens direct standing to sue other citizens, although they may have an indirect impact on individuals through national laws that implement them.\n4. Directives are considered addressed to member states, leaving them with the choice of form and methods to implement them, in accordance with TFEU article 288.\n5. Directives often create minimum standards, allowing member states to apply higher standards if desired. For example, the Working Time Directive requires at least 4 weeks paid holidays per year, but many countries may implement longer holiday periods.\n6. Citizens can claim rights based on national laws that implement Directives, but not directly from the Directives themselves.\n7. Directives do not have \"horizontal\" direct effect, meaning they do not create rights and duties between non-state parties.\n8. The current position adopted by the Court of Justice regarding Directives is that they do not provide direct standing to citizens to sue each other, but three Advocate Generals argued in the early 1990s that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens.\n9. The Court of Justice refused the argument that Directives should provide direct standing to citizens, but there are five large exceptions to this general rule.\n10. The distinction between direct and indirect effect of EU law highlights the complex relationship between EU regulations and national laws, as well as the role of the Court of Justice in interpreting and applying these laws.\n11. The concept of minimum standards in Directives allows for flexibility and adaptability in national implementation, potentially leading to a range of different approaches and outcomes across member states.\n12. The limited standing of citizens in relation to Directives may lead to a greater emphasis on national-level enforcement and compliance mechanisms, as citizens are unable to directly sue for violations of EU law.\n13. The exceptions to the general rule regarding the direct standing of citizens in relation to Directives may provide valuable case law and precedent for future legal challenges and interpretations of EU law.\n14. The distinction between direct and indirect effect of EU law may have implications for the interpretation and application of other international agreements and treaties, as well as for the development of international law more broadly.\n15.

Vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system that mankind has developed.\n6. Infectious disease remains one of the leading causes of death in the human population.\n7. Active immunity involves the development of specific immunity against a particular pathogen without causing the associated disease.\n8. Vaccines contain antigens from a pathogen that stimulate the immune system to recognize and respond to that specific pathogen.\n9. Vaccination helps to prepare the immune system to quickly and effectively respond to future infections by the same pathogen.\n10. Vaccines can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases within communities and populations.\n11. Vaccines have been responsible for the eradication or significant reduction of several deadly infectious diseases, such as smallpox and polio.\n12. Vaccination can be an effective way to protect individuals who may not have been exposed to a particular pathogen, as well as those who may have a weakened immune system or are unable to receive certain vaccines.\n13. Vaccines can be made from a variety of components, including weakened or killed pathogens, specific proteins (antigens) from the pathogen, or genetic material (DNA or RNA) from the pathogen.\n14. The development of vaccines involves a rigorous process of testing and evaluation to ensure their safety and efficacy.\n15. Vaccination is often administered through injections, but can also be given orally, through nasal sprays, or other routes depending on the specific vaccine.\n16. Some vaccines require multiple doses or boosters to provide long-lasting immunity.\n17. Vaccine efficacy can be affected by various factors, including the individual's immune system, age, and overall health status.\n18.

The immune system's response to vaccination is similar to its response to natural infection, but without the risk of disease.\n23. Vaccines can be used to provide active immunity, whereas passive immunity is obtained through the administration of antibodies from another individual or source.\n24. Vaccination is an effective way to prevent the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and economies.\n25. The immune system's ability to recognize and respond to specific antigens is crucial for the development of effective vaccines.\n26. The immune system's response to vaccination can vary among individuals, potentially affecting the overall effectiveness of a vaccine.\n27. Vaccination can help to reduce the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant infections by reducing the prevalence of infectious diseases.\n28. Vaccines can be tailored to target specific strains or subtypes of a pathogen, providing more targeted protection against those variants.\n29. Vaccination can be an important tool in disease surveillance and monitoring, as it can help to track the prevalence of specific pathogens and inform public health strategies.\n30. The immune system's response to vaccination can be evaluated through various serological tests, such as antibody assays, to assess vaccine efficacy and immune response.\n31. Vaccination can be an important part of旅行疫苗接种计划, helping individuals prepare for potential exposure to pathogens in different regions of the world.\n32. The immune system's ability to generate memory cells can be harnessed to develop vaccines for diseases that currently have no effective treatment, such as HIV and malaria.\n33. Vaccines can be developed using novel technologies, such as recombinant DNA, viral vectors, or mRNA, to target specific antigens or pathogen components.\n34. Vaccination can be an important tool in controlling and preventing the emergence of new infectious diseases, such as those caused by emerging pathogens or strains.\n35. Vaccination can be an important component of disease prevention strategies in high-risk populations, such as healthcare workers, immunocompromised individuals, and those living in close quarters (e.g., in prisons or refugee camps).\n36. Vaccination can be an important tool in addressing health disparities and reducing the burden of infectious diseases in underserved populations.\n37. Vaccination can be an important part of pandemic preparedness and response, helping to protect populations from highly contagious and potentially deadly diseases.\n38. The immune system's response to vaccination can provide insights into the basic mechanisms of immune function and help inform the development of new therapeutic strategies.\n39. Vaccination can be an important part of infectious disease research, helping to identify novel antigens, pathogen strains, or epidemiological patterns.\n40. Vaccination can be an important tool in promoting public health awareness and education about infectious diseases and their prevention.\n41. Vaccination can be an important part of travel medicine, helping individuals prepare for potential exposure to pathogens in different regions of the world.\n42. Vaccination can be an important tool in addressing the challenge of vaccine hesitancy and increasing public trust in vaccines.\n43. Vaccination can be an important part of global health initiatives, such as the World Health Organization's Global Vaccine Action Plan.\n44. Vaccination can be an important part of environmental health, as it can help reduce the need for antibiotic use in agriculture and promote the use of vaccines as a more sustainable and effective way to control infectious diseases.\n45. Vaccination can be an important part of public health emergency preparedness and response, helping to ensure a rapid and effective response to outbreaks or other public health threats.\n46. Vaccination can be an important part of chronic disease management, as it can help reduce the risk of infections that may exacerbate underlying health conditions.\n47.

Due to FCC ownership rules, the transaction, which was to include the purchase of three RCA stations by Noble, would require him to resell his station with the FCC's approval. The Commission authorized the transaction on October 12, 1943. Soon afterward, the Blue Network was purchased by the new company Noble founded, the American Broadcasting System. Noble subsequently acquired the rights to the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer in 1944; its parent company adopted the corporate name American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

The gonads of Ctenophora species are located in the internal canal network beneath the comb rows.\n5. Eggs and sperm are released through pores in the epidermis of the Ctenophora organism.\n6.

In species of the genus Mnemiopsis, self-fertilization has been observed, and it is believed that many hermaphroditic Ctenophora species are capable of self-fertilization as well.\n9. The reproductive strategy of Ctenophora species allows for a high degree of genetic diversity, as they can potentially mate with any other individual of the same species.\n10. The ability to switch between different reproductive strategies (external fertilization and self-fertilization) may provide Ctenophora species with an advantage in adapting to various environmental conditions.\n11. The presence of hermaphroditism in Ctenophora species may reduce the need for complex courtship behaviors and mate searching, as individuals can potentially reproduce with any other member of their species.\n12. The internal fertilization observed in platyctenid Ctenophora species may provide a level of protection for developing eggs, increasing their chances of successful hatching.\n13. The ability to keep eggs in brood chambers during development may allow for more controlled and regulated reproduction in platyctenid Ctenophora species.\n14. The observation of self-fertilization in Mnemiopsis species suggests that asexual reproduction may play a role in the reproductive strategies of some Ctenophora species.\n15. The combination of sexual and asexual reproduction strategies may provide Ctenophora species with increased flexibility and adaptability in response to environmental changes.\n16. The study of Ctenophora reproductive strategies may provide insights into the evolution of reproductive systems in other animal groups.\n17. The unique reproductive characteristics of Ctenophora species may make them valuable model organisms for studying the biology of reproduction and development.\n18. The ability of Ctenophora species to switch between different reproductive strategies may have important implications for their population dynamics and ecological interactions with other organisms.\n19. The observation of self-fertilization in Ctenophora species may have important implications for the genetics and evolution of these animals, as it could lead to a decrease in genetic diversity over time.\n20.

The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient.\n5. There can be up to a thousand times as many hydrogen ions inside the thylakoid system as in the stroma.\n6. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through ATP synthase.\n7. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.\n8. Chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, allowing ATP to be synthesized there.\n9. The synthesized ATP is in position to be used in the dark reactions.\n10. Chloroplasts play a crucial role in capturing light energy and converting it into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis.\n11. The energy generated by chloroplasts is essential for the growth and survival of photosynthetic organisms, such as plants, algae, and some bacteria.\n12. The H+ gradient created by the chloroplasts is similar to the proton motive force generated by mitochondria, which is used to drive ATP synthesis.\n13. The electron transport chain in chloroplasts and mitochondria share similarities in their structure and function, although they operate in different cellular compartments.\n14. The process of ATP synthesis in chloroplasts is dependent on the availability of hydrogen ions, which are produced by the splitting of water molecules during photosystem II.\n15. The electron transport chain in chloroplasts is responsible for generating a proton gradient, which drives the synthesis of ATP through ATP synthase.\n16. The electron transport chain in chloroplasts involves the transfer of electrons from water molecules to various electron carriers, ultimately resulting in the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH.\n17. NADPH, along with ATP, plays a crucial role in the Calvin cycle, the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide is fixed and converted into organic molecules.\n18. The efficiency of ATP synthesis in chloroplasts can be affected by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and the availability of water and carbon dioxide.\n19. Chloroplasts have the ability to adapt to different environmental conditions, such as changes in light intensity or temperature, by adjusting the rate of ATP synthesis and the efficiency of the electron transport chain.\n20. The presence of chloroplasts in photosynthetic organisms allows them to harness energy from sunlight and convert it into a form that can be used for various cellular processes, such as growth, reproduction, and maintenance.\n21. Chloroplasts are organelles found in the cells of plants, algae, and some bacteria, which are responsible for photosynthesis.\n22. The two photosystems in chloroplasts, Photosystem I and Photosystem II, are involved in the capture and conversion of light energy into chemical energy.\n23. Photosystem II is responsible for the initial splitting of water molecules, releasing oxygen and electrons, while Photosystem I captures light energy and uses the electrons to reduce NADP+ to NADPH.\n24. The electron transport chain in chloroplasts involves a series of proteins and electron carriers, including plastocyanin, cytochrome b6f complex, and cytochrome oxidase-like protein, which facilitate the transfer of electrons and protons.\n25. The ATP synthase in chloroplasts is a large enzyme complex that synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate using the energy released by the flow of hydrogen ions through the enzyme.\n26. The stroma, the matrix inside the chloroplast, contains various enzymes and molecules necessary for the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, such as the Calvin cycle.\n27. The thylakoid space, located inside the chloroplasts, is where the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis take place.\n28. The concentration gradient of hydrogen ions between the thylakoid space and the stroma is crucial for the generation of ATP through chemiosmosis.\n29. Chloroplasts have their own genome, which encodes some of the proteins involved in photosynthesis and other chloroplast functions.\n30. The chloroplast genome is typically circular and much smaller than the nuclear genome, but it still contains essential genes for chloroplast function.\n31. Chloroplasts can undergo semi-autonomous replication and gene expression, meaning they can synthesize some of their own proteins and RNA molecules.\n32. Chloroplasts are thought to have evolved from ancient cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis, a process where one organism (in this case, a cyanobacterium) is engulfed by another organism (a eukaryotic cell) and eventually becomes a symbiotic organelle.\n33. The endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts explains the similarities between the structure and function of chloroplasts and mitochondria, despite their different evolutionary origins.\n34. The chloroplast genome has undergone significant changes since its origin, including gene transfer to the nuclear genome and changes in gene content and organization.\n35. The chloroplast genome is highly conserved across photosynthetic organisms, indicating a common ancestry and suggesting that it has undergone limited adaptive changes.\n36. The function of chloroplasts is not limited to photosynthesis; they also play roles in other cellular processes, such as lipid synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species.\n37. Chloroplasts are involved in the regulation of plant development and stress responses, such as those related to light, temperature, and nutrient availability.\n38. The efficiency of photosynthesis and ATP synthesis in chloroplasts can be affected by various factors, such as the presence of inhibitors, pollutants, or other environmental stressors.\n39. The study of chloroplasts and their function has important implications for understanding the evolution of photosynthetic organisms and the development of sustainable energy sources.\n40. Investigating the molecular mechanisms of ATP synthesis in chloroplasts can lead to the discovery of novel enzymes and proteins that could be used in biotechnological applications, such as the production of biofuels or the development of more efficient solar cells.",

The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss.

Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]\n\nImplications:\n"

In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules.[a]\n\nImplications:\n"

Another key idea is dividing user messages into message blocks, later called packets.\n10. The final key idea is the delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.\n11. Packet switching is a communication technology that enables data to be transmitted in small units called packets.\n12. Packet switching allows for a more efficient use of network resources by sending data in smaller, manageable pieces.\n13. The use of multiple paths between any two points in a decentralized network increases the resilience of the communication system, as it can continue to function even if some paths fail.\n14. Packet switching allows for flexible routing of data, as packets can take different paths through the network depending on traffic conditions and other factors.\n15. The store and forward switching mechanism enables packets to be stored at intermediate nodes and forwarded when the destination node becomes available.\n16. Packet switching is a fundamental concept in modern computer networks, including the Internet.\n17. The idea of distributed adaptive message block switching laid the foundation for modern packet switching networks.\n18. The concept of packet switching has been applied to various types of networks, including wired and wireless networks.\n19. Packet switching enables efficient use of network bandwidth, as multiple packets can be transmitted simultaneously over different paths.\n20. The principles of packet switching have been extended to other areas, such as queuing theory and network design.\n21. Packet switching has led to the development of various protocols, such as Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).\n22. The concept of packet switching has influenced the design of modern computing systems, including routers, switches, and firewalls.\n23. Packet switching has improved the reliability and robustness of communication systems, as it can recover from link failures and other disruptions.\n24. The principles of packet switching have been applied to other areas, such as data storage and caching.\n25.

Sometimes, the reenergized electrons can flow back down more H+-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP.\n5. This process is called cyclic photophosphorylation.\n6. Cyclic photophosphorylation is common in C4 plants.\n7. C4 plants require more ATP than NADPH.\n8. Chloroplasts are involved in photosynthesis and energy production.\n9. Photosynthesis involves the use of light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n10. Photosystem II and photosystem I are two components of the photosynthetic process.\n11. The electron transport chain is a series of protein complexes that transfer electrons from photosystem II to photosystem I.\n12. ATP is generated by the pumping of hydrogen ions across a membrane, creating a proton gradient.\n13. NADP+ is a coenzyme that accepts electrons in photosystem I and is used to reduce carbon dioxide during the Calvin cycle.\n14. Cyclic photophosphorylation allows for the generation of ATP without the reduction of NADP+.\n15. Cyclic photophosphorylation may be an adaptation to high light intensities, as it can provide an additional source of ATP.\n16. C4 plants have adapted to high light intensities and hot temperatures, which can limit the efficiency of photosynthesis.\n17. C4 plants have a different photosynthetic pathway compared to other plants, which involves the formation of a four-carbon compound (HMP) before carbon fixation.\n18. C4 plants have specialized mesophyll cells called bundle sheath cells, which contain chloroplasts and are involved in the Calvin cycle.\n19. The Calvin cycle is the light-independent phase of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide is fixed and reduced to glucose.\n20. The ATP generated during photosynthesis is used to power various cellular processes, such as the synthesis of proteins and other organic molecules.\n21. The oxygen released during photosynthesis is a byproduct of the photolysis of water and is essential for aerobic respiration in most living organisms.\n22. The efficiency of photosynthesis can be affected by factors such as light intensity, temperature, and the availability of nutrients.\n23. Optimization of photosynthesis is an important area of research in plant biology, as it can lead to the development of crops with higher yields and improved resistance to environmental stress.\n24. Understanding the mechanisms of photosynthesis can also contribute to the development of artificial photosynthesis systems for the production of fuels and other chemicals.\n25. The study of photosynthesis can provide insights into the evolution of photosynthetic organisms and their adaptations to different environments.\n26. The thylakoid membrane, where photosynthesis occurs, is composed of lipids and proteins and provides a unique environment for the functioning of photosystem II and photosystem I.\n27. The electron transport chain in chloroplasts is similar to the one found in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells, suggesting a common ancestry for these organelles.\n28. The presence of photosystem I and photosystem II in chloroplasts demonstrates the modular nature of photosynthesis, with different components responsible for different aspects of the process.\n29. The reuptake of electrons by NADP+ in the Calvin cycle allows for the reduction of carbon dioxide to form glucose.\n30. The cyclic photophosphorylation process can help to maintain the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is essential for the proper functioning of the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis.\n31. The ability of chloroplasts to generate ATP through cyclic photophosphorylation can contribute to the overall energy balance of the plant cell.\n32. The specialization of bundle sheath cells in C4 plants allows for a more efficient use of resources, as it separates the light-dependent and light-independent phases of photosynthesis.\n33. The Calvin cycle in C4 plants can proceed more rapidly than in C3 plants, due to the higher concentration of CO2 in the bundle sheath cells.\n34. C4 plants are generally found in hot and dry environments, where their specialized photosynthetic pathway provides a competitive advantage.\n35. The study of photosynthesis can contribute to our understanding of the global carbon cycle and its role in mitigating climate change.\n36. The efficiency of photosynthesis can be improved through the manipulation of plant genetics and the optimization of environmental conditions.\n37. Understanding the mechanisms of photosynthesis can lead to the development of more efficient solar cells and other energy-harvesting technologies.\n38. The study of photosynthesis can provide insights into the evolution of life on Earth, as it is one of the most fundamental processes for the survival of most organisms.\n39. The thylakoid membrane and its associated proteins are targets for research into the development of new drugs and therapies for diseases affecting photosynthesis in plants.\n40. The study of photosynthesis can contribute to our understanding of the biosphere and its intricate relationships with other ecological processes.",

This pattern of higher incomes-longer lives still holds among poorer countries, where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases, but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world. Americans live no longer on average (about 77 years in 2004) than Greeks (78 years) or New Zealanders (78), though the USA has a higher GDP per capita. Life expectancy in Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82) – where income was more equally distributed – was longer.\n\nImplications:\n"

He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God.

Luther's relationship with Aristotle was complex, with a love-hate dynamic due to Aristotle's emphasis on reason, which Luther found unsatisfying in his pursuit of understanding God.\n9. Luther's experience with philosophy and his eventual focus on theology and Scripture suggest a shift in his spiritual and philosophical beliefs.\n10. Luther's decision to drop out of law school and pursue theology and philosophy may have been influenced by his desire for personal fulfillment and a deeper understanding of God.\n11.

Luther's focus on theology and Scripture may have led to a more personal and individualized approach to religion, prioritizing personal understanding and experience over institutional authority.\n14. Luther's experience with philosophy and theology may have contributed to his later theological ideas, such as justification by faith alone and the priesthood of all believers.\n15. Luther's skepticism towards reason may have been a response to the limitations he perceived in its ability to provide answers about the divine and the spiritual.\n16. Luther's emphasis on divine revelation through Scripture may have contributed to the development of the Protestant Reformation, as he sought to return to the original teachings of the Bible and challenge the authority of the Catholic Church.\n17. Luther's experiences with philosophy and theology may have influenced his approach to education and intellectual inquiry, emphasizing critical thinking and personal experience over dogmatic beliefs.\n18. Luther's focus on individual understanding and experience of God may have contributed to the development of individualism and personal spirituality in religious thought and practice.\n19. Luther's skepticism towards reason may have been a reflection of the broader intellectual and philosophical debates of his time, including the Renaissance and the early modern period.\n20.

While experimenting with mechanical oscillators at his Houston Street lab, Tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings. As the speed grew, it is said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and, belatedly realizing the danger, he was forced to use a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment, just as the police arrived.:162–164 In February 1912, an article—\"Nikola Tesla, Dreamer\" by Allan L.

The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time.

The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\". Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while within the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.\n\nImplications:\n"

In the 9th, it formed part of the border between Middle and Western Francia, but in the 10th century, it was fully within the Holy Roman Empire, flowing through Swabia, Franconia and Lower Lorraine. The mouths of the Rhine, in the county of Holland, fell to the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th century; Holland remained contentious territory throughout the European wars of religion and the eventual collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, when the length of the Rhine fell to the First French Empire and its client states. The Alsace on the left banks of the Upper Rhine was sold to Burgundy by Archduke Sigismund of Austria in 1469 and eventually fell to France in the Thirty Years' War. The numerous historic castles in Rhineland-Palatinate attest to the importance of the river as a commercial route.\n\nImplications:\n"

First, the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther, whom Leo then summoned to Rome. The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet was held. There, in October 1518, under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist. The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy. The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than his writing the 95 Theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope. Cajetan's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant, but the legate desisted from doing so. Luther slipped out of the city at night, unbeknownst to Cajetan.\n\nImplications:\n"

A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.\n\nImplications:\n"

For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68 °F). Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.\n\nImplications:\n"

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote.

Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999).

However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"",

A July 23, 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported Woods Hole Research Center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a \"tipping point\" where it would irreversibly start to die.

In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC is broadcast in the United States, although the network's programming is syndicated in many countries. The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on September 27 of that year, ABC announced the launch of ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group. However, on September 8, 2007, Disney announced that it would discontinue ABC1 citing to the channel's inability to attain sustainable viewership.

Whenever a first body exerts a force F on a second body, the second body exerts a force −F on the first body. F and −F are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The action and the reaction are simultaneous.\n6. The Third Law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects.\n7. The Third Law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law.\n8. The \"action\" (F) and the \"reaction\" (-F) are simultaneous.\n9. Forces always come in pairs, with each force acting on a different object.\n10. The direction of the reaction force is always opposite to the direction of the action force.\n11. The magnitude of the reaction force is always equal to the magnitude of the action force.\n12. The Third Law applies to all types of forces, including gravitational, electromagnetic, and contact forces.\n13. The Third Law can be observed in everyday life, such as when pushing against a wall or when two objects collide.\n14. The Third Law helps explain why objects move in response to forces, as the reaction force is what causes the motion.\n15. The Third Law is essential in understanding the concept of momentum, as the total momentum of a system remains constant in the absence of external forces.\n16. The Third Law is a fundamental principle in mechanics and is used in the development of many engineering and physics concepts.\n17. The Third Law can be extended to describe the interaction between a body and its surroundings, such as a satellite orbiting a planet.\n18. The Third Law can be used to analyze and predict the behavior of objects in various situations, such as the motion of planets, the interaction between fluids and solids, and the dynamics of particles in a gas.\n19. The Third Law is a cornerstone of classical mechanics and has been verified through numerous experiments and observations.\n20. The Third Law is an essential component of Newton's Laws of Motion and is used in the derivation of many other physical concepts, such as friction, viscosity, and drag.\n21. The Third Law can be generalized to describe the interaction between systems, not just individual objects.\n22. The Third Law can be applied to non-inertial reference frames, although with some modifications to account for fictitious forces.\n23. The Third Law is a local law, meaning that it only describes the interaction between two objects at a specific point in space and time.\n24. The Third Law can be used to analyze the motion of celestial bodies, such as the orbit of the Moon around the Earth or the motion of stars in a galaxy.\n25. The Third Law can be used to understand the behavior of particles in quantum mechanics, such as the exchange of virtual particles between interacting particles.\n26. The Third Law can be used to study the behavior of materials under stress, such as the deformation of solids or the flow of fluids.\n27. The Third Law can be used to analyze the stability of structures and the distribution of forces in engineering applications, such as bridge design or building construction.\n28. The Third Law can be used to understand the behavior of fluids, such as the flow of water in a pipe or the motion of air in the atmosphere.\n29. The Third Law can be used to study the behavior of gases, such as the effusion of gases through a small hole or the expansion of a gas in a piston.\n30. The Third Law can be used to analyze the motion of objects in a gravitational field, such as the orbit of a satellite or the motion of a planet around the Sun.\n31. The Third Law can be used to study the behavior of electromagnetic fields, such as the interaction between a charged particle and an electric field.\n32. The Third Law can be used to analyze the motion of objects in a fluid, such as the drag force on an object moving through a fluid.\n33.

The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies,[Note 3] and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body. Whenever a first body exerts a force F on a second body, the second body exerts a force −F on the first body. F and −F are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law, with F called the \"action\" and −F the \"reaction\". The action and the reaction are simultaneous:\n\nImplications:\n"

Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation. Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law.

Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation. Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law. Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people.\n\nImplications:\n"

The plague also had a devastating effect on Stockholm's population, claiming a third of its inhabitants.\n8. The last major plague epidemic in Europe occurred in 1720 in Marseille.\n9. Plagues led to a significant decrease in the population of various cities and regions in Europe.\n10. The impact of plagues was not limited to a single country or region, as they affected many parts of Europe during the 17th century.\n11. The spread of plagues was likely facilitated by the increased mobility of people and goods during the 17th century, which contributed to the rapid transmission of the disease.\n12. Plagues had a significant impact on the economy and social structure of the affected regions, as a large portion of the population died, leaving behind a shortage of labor and resources.\n13. The repeated occurrence of plagues in Europe during the 17th century highlights the need for improved sanitation, hygiene, and public health measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.\n14. The response to plagues, such as quarantine measures and isolation of affected individuals, had a significant impact on social interactions and the way people lived their daily lives.\n15. The memory of plagues and their devastating effects may have influenced artistic and literary works of the time, reflecting the fear and uncertainty that these epidemics brought to society.\n16. The study of plagues and their impact on European history can provide valuable insights into the development of public health policies and the importance of addressing the root causes of infectious diseases.\n17. The recurrence of plagues during the 17th century highlights the vulnerability of human populations to infectious diseases, even in the absence of modern medical technology and advanced healthcare systems.\n18. The effectiveness of different public health measures, such as quarantine and isolation, in controlling the spread of plagues can be analyzed to inform contemporary public health strategies.\n19. The economic impact of plagues, such as decreased productivity and increased poverty, can be examined to better understand the long-term consequences of infectious diseases on societies.\n20. The social and psychological effects of plagues, such as increased mortality rates and the breakdown of social structures, can be studied to gain a deeper understanding of the human response to catastrophic events.",

Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken.

Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.[citation needed]\n\nImplications:\n"

On September 30, 1960, ABC premiered The Flintstones, another example of counterprogramming; although the animated series from William Hanna and Joseph Barbera was filmed in color from the beginning, it was initially broadcast in black-and-white, as ABC had not made the necessary technical upgrades to broadcast its programming in color at the time. The Flintstones allowed ABC to present a novelty, that of prime-time animated programming, but it also allowed the network to begin filling the hole opened by the conclusion of the Disney partnership by carrying family-oriented programming from other producers.\n\nImplications:\n"

Among these are the Oriental Institute—a museum and research center for Near Eastern studies owned and operated by the university—and a number of National Resource Centers, including the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. Chicago also operates or is affiliated with a number of research institutions apart from the university proper. The university partially manages Argonne National Laboratory, part of the United States Department of Energy's national laboratory system, and has a joint stake in Fermilab, a nearby particle physics laboratory, as well as a stake in the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico. Faculty and students at the adjacent Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago collaborate with the university, In 2013, the university announced that it was affiliating the formerly independent Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass.

The transfer of passive immunity through antibody-rich serum is a medical intervention to provide immediate protection against infections in cases where the body's immune system is not yet fully developed or compromised.\n11. The immune system of newborn infants relies on passive immunity provided by the mother until their own immune system becomes fully functional.\n12. The transfer of antibodies from the mother to the newborn is a crucial aspect of the baby's immune system development and protection.\n13. The short-term nature of passive immunity highlights the importance of the newborn's immune system developing its own memory cells and antibodies over time.\n14. The use of antibody-rich serum for transferring passive immunity is a temporary solution, providing immediate protection until the newborn's immune system can take over.\n15. The transfer of passive immunity through antibody-rich serum can be a valuable tool in medical settings, such as in cases of premature births or newborns with compromised immune systems.\n16. The mother's IgG antibodies are an essential component of passive immunity in newborn infants, providing them with immediate protection against infections.\n17. The transfer of antibodies from the mother to the newborn is a natural process that occurs during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n18. The range of antigen specificities in the newborn's antibodies is limited to those present in the mother's antibodies, which can lead to limitations in protecting against new or previously unknown pathogens.\n19. The development of an infant's immune system is a gradual process that occurs over time, with memory cells and antibodies being produced as the infant is exposed to various pathogens.\n20. Passive immunity provided by the mother is a crucial component of a newborn's immune system, but it is not a long-term solution and must be supplemented by the development of the infant's own immune system.\n21. The transfer of passive immunity through antibody-rich serum can be a valuable tool for protecting newborns in cases where the mother's antibodies are not sufficient or when the newborn is at risk of severe infections.\n22. The immune system of newborn infants is highly dependent on the passive protection provided by the mother, highlighting the importance of maternal health and immune status.\n23. The transfer of passive immunity through antibody-rich serum can be used as a temporary measure to protect newborns in high-risk situations, such as outbreaks of infectious diseases or in developing countries with limited access to healthcare.\n24. The development of an infant's immune system is a complex process that involves the production of memory cells and antibodies in response to various pathogens.\n25. The transfer of passive immunity through antibody-rich serum can be a valuable tool for protecting newborns in situations where the infant's immune system is not yet fully functional or when the mother's antibodies are not sufficient.\n26.

Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. During pregnancy, a particular type of antibody, called IgG, is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta, so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies—it only borrows them. This passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months. In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum.\n\nImplications:\n"

Shiller said that rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem. Increasing inequality harms economic growth. High and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth.\n\nImplications:\n"

The Mongol army's rapid advances and victories may have contributed to the Tanguts' decision to negotiate a peace treaty or seek a different outcome.\n15. The Mongol-Tangut conflict likely had broader implications for the political and military landscape of the region, potentially leading to changes in alliances and power dynamics.\n16. Genghis Khan's military campaigns may have set a precedent for future conquests and expansions by the Mongol Empire.\n17. The Tanguts may have faced internal divisions or weaknesses that contributed to their defeat by the Mongols.\n18. The Mongol army's ability to cross rivers and engage in successful sieges may have been key factors in their victories against the Tanguts.\n19. The Tanguts may have underestimated the Mongol army's capabilities and resources.\n20.

Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.\n\nImplications:\n"

Trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism, and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about Islam and Islamic law. Maududi founded the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972. However, Maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising. His extremely influential books (translated into many languages) placed Islam in a modern context, and influenced not only conservative ulema but liberal modernizer Islamists such as al-Faruqi, whose \"Islamization of Knowledge\" carried forward some of Maududi's key principles.\n\nImplications:\n"

The chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and has no nucleomorph—all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred to the dinophyte nucleus. The endosymbiotic event that led to this chloroplast was serial secondary endosymbiosis rather than tertiary endosymbiosis—the endosymbiont was a green alga containing a primary chloroplast (making a secondary chloroplast).\n\nImplications:\n"

Oxygen bars are establishments, found in Japan, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal O\n2 exposure for a fee. Professional athletes, especially in American football, also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a \"boost\" in performance. The pharmacological effect is doubtful; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation. Available studies support a performance boost from enriched O\n2 mixtures only if they are breathed during aerobic exercise.\n\nImplications:\n"

This suggests that large portions of the Amazon rainforest may have been managed by indigenous peoples for centuries, rather than naturally occurring as previously thought.\n6. The discovery of terra preta challenges the traditional understanding of the Amazon rainforest as a pristine, untouched ecosystem.\n7. The presence of terra preta indicates that indigenous peoples had a profound impact on the landscape of the Amazon forest.\n8. The development of fertile soil through indigenous soil management allowed for the establishment of large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest.\n9. Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida discovered remains of these large settlements in 2003.\n10. The remains included evidence of roads, bridges, and large plazas.\n11. These findings suggest that indigenous peoples had advanced knowledge of engineering and urban planning.\n12. The existence of large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest challenges the traditional understanding of the region as sparsely populated.\n13. The discovery of terra preta and the remains of large settlements in the Amazon forest has important implications for our understanding of human history and the development of agriculture.\n14. It raises questions about the potential for sustainable agriculture and soil management in the Amazon forest today.\n15. The discovery of these settlements and the use of terra preta suggests that indigenous peoples were able to live in harmony with the environment and maintain a sustainable way of life.\n16. This could provide valuable insights for contemporary efforts to promote sustainable agriculture and conservation in the Amazon rainforest.\n17. The presence of large settlements in the Amazon forest suggests that indigenous peoples were able to support a significant population size in the region.\n18. This challenges the traditional narrative of the Amazon rainforest as a remote and unpopulated area.\n19. The discovery of terra preta and the remains of large settlements highlights the need for further research and documentation of indigenous knowledge and practices related to agriculture and land management in the Amazon rainforest.\n20. The findings may also have implications for the rights and recognition of indigenous peoples in the region, as they demonstrate the long-standing presence and impact of indigenous communities in the Amazon forest.\n21.

As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up. This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were short cut and groynes were built, to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up.\n\nImplications:\n"

The measurement of the gravitational constant allowed for the calculation of the mass of the Earth.\n5. Newton's Law of Gravitation states that the force on a spherical object due to the gravitational pull of another object is directly proportional to the product of their masses.\n6. The force is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers of the two objects.\n7. Newton's law of gravity applies universally, meaning it can be used to describe the gravitational interaction between any two celestial bodies.\n8. The equation for gravitational force can be used to solve for the mass of an object given its gravitational force and the mass of another object.\n9. The gravitational constant is a fundamental constant of nature, and its value is the same throughout the universe.\n10. The discovery of Newton's Law of Gravitation revolutionized our understanding of the universe and paved the way for the development of modern physics.\n11.

The gravitational force between two objects is independent of the presence of other objects or forces in the vicinity.\n15.

The gravitational force between two objects is always conservative, meaning the work done in moving an object from one point to another is independent of the path taken.\n17. The gravitational force between two objects is always symmetric, meaning the force on object 1 due to object 2 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force on object 2 due to object 1.\n18.

The majority of building construction jobs are small renovations, such as addition of a room, or renovation of a bathroom. Often, the owner of the property acts as laborer, paymaster, and design team for the entire project. Although building construction projects typically include various common elements, such as design, financial, estimating and legal considerations, many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results, such as structural collapse, cost overruns, and/or litigation. For this reason, those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome.\n\nImplications:\n"
