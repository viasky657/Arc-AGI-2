While Treaties and Regulations give citizens direct standing to sue other citizens, Directives do not. This is because Directives are addressed to the member states and do not explicitly grant rights and duties to individual citizens. Moreover, Directives often create minimum standards, allowing member states to apply higher standards if they choose to do so. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks of paid holidays each year. However, most member states have implemented stricter provisions in their national laws, providing for more than 28 days of paid leave.\n\nThe Court of Justice's decision to limit the direct effect of Directives has been met with criticism. Three Advocate Generals have argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens. Although the Court of Justice rejected this view, there are still several significant exceptions where citizens can rely on Directives to protect their rights.

The crisis prompted federal safety standards, such as the NHTSA Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 215 (relating to safety bumpers), and compact designs like the 1974 Mustang I. This period laid the groundwork for the subsequent \"downsize\" revisions in vehicle categories, as evidenced by GM's full-sized car lineup in 1977. By 1979, virtually all full-sized American cars had downsized, incorporating smaller engines and dimensions. Similarly, Chrysler ceased production of their full-sized luxury sedans by the end of the 1981 model year, transitioning to a full front-wheel drive lineup in 1982, with the notable exceptions of the M-body Dodge Diplomat/Plymouth Gran Fury and Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue sedans.\n\n2008 financial crisis: A major global economic downturn that began in the United States in 2008, primarily due to the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent housing crisis. The crisis triggered a series of financial turmoil, leading to a deep recession and a significant decline in economic activity across various industries, including the automotive sector. The 2008 financial crisis had far-reaching consequences, impacting consumer confidence, automobile sales, and the overall stability of the global economy. As a result, the crisis led to the development of new safety standards and a shift towards more fuel-efficient and downsized vehicles, as well as a transformation in the automotive industry's approach to risk management and financial stability.\n\n2020 global pandemic: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global economy, including the automotive industry. The crisis has led to widespread shutdowns, supply chain disruptions, and a significant decline in consumer demand for new vehicles. The pandemic has also accelerated the shift towards electric and autonomous vehicles, as well as the adoption of advanced safety features and technologies. Additionally, the crisis has highlighted the importance of resilience and flexibility in the automotive sector, as companies must navigate the ever-changing landscape of the global economy and adapt to new challenges and opportunities.",

While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen. This makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

French and Indian War\nIn 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue, leading a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians, was tasked with protecting the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. He followed the route Céloron had mapped out four years prior, constructing and garrisoning forts at Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania), Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania), and other locations along the way. While Céloron had limited his claim to the French by burying lead plates, Marin constructed and defended these new forts to assert French dominance in the region. Despite these actions, Marin faced opposition from the British and the Iroquois, who were driven away or captured by his forces. Additionally, Tanaghrisson, a Mingo chief, expressed intense dislike for the French, accusing them of killing and eating his father. Tanaghrisson then visited Fort Le Boeuf, where he threatened the French with military action, which Marin dismissed in a display of contempt.\n\n2. French and Indian War\nDuring the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue led a significant 2,000-man force consisting of Troupes de la Marine and Indian allies in an effort to safeguard the King's land in the Ohio Valley from potential British incursions. Marin followed the same route previously traversed by Céloron, four years earlier, and constructed and garrisoned a series of forts, including Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) and Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania). While Céloron had only marked his claims through the burial of lead plates, Marin's construction of these fortified positions solidified French control over the region. However, Marin's actions raised tensions with both the British and the Iroquois, who were forced to retreat or surrender to his forces. Furthermore, Tanaghrisson, a Mingo chief, harbored strong animosity towards the French, accusing them of violence against his family. Upon visiting Fort Le Boeuf, Tanaghrisson confronted the French, issuing a threat of military action, which Marin dismissed, displaying a lack of regard for his opponent's intentions.\n\n3. French and Indian War\nIn the early 1750s, Paul Marin de la Malgue led a formidable 2,000-man contingent comprising Troupes de la Marine and Indian allies in a mission to protect the King's territory in the Ohio Valley from British intrusion. Following in the footsteps of Céloron, who had established his presence four years earlier, Marin constructed and fortified a series of strategic locations, including Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) and Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania). Unlike Céloron, who had merely buried lead plates to symbolize French claims, Marin's construction of these fortified positions reinforced French dominance over the region. However, Marin's aggressive tactics not only alarmed the British but also alienated the Iroquois, who were compelled to retreat or surrender to his forces. Furthermore, Tanaghrisson, a Mingo chief, harbored deep animosity towards the French, accusing them of violence against his family. Upon visiting Fort Le Boeuf, Tanaghrisson confronted the French, issuing a threat of military action, which Marin dismissed, displaying a dismissive attitude towards his opponent's intentions.\n\n4. French and Indian War\nIn 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue led a significant 2,000-man force consisting of Troupes de la Marine and Indian allies in an effort to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from British aggression. Following the path established by Céloron four years prior, Marin constructed and fortified several strategic locations, such as Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) and Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania). Unlike Céloron, who had limited his claims to the French by burying lead plates, Marin's construction of these fortified positions reinforced French dominance over the region. Despite his efforts, Marin's actions sparked tensions with both the British and the Iroquois, who were driven away or captured by his forces.

His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years earlier, but where Céloron had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) on Lake Erie's south shore. He had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. Marin constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania), designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson, a chief of the Mingo, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. He intensely disliked the French (whom he accused of killing and eating his father). Traveling to Fort Le Boeuf, he threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare and PharMerica). This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

In addition, they held many important ports across the English Channel, which further strengthened their ties. Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, married King Ethelred II of England, leading to closer bloodlines between the two families. When Ethelred was forced out of his kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013, he sought refuge in Normandy, where he stayed until 1016.

The Role of Normans in Anglo-Norman Relations: The Normans played a crucial role in shaping the relationship between England and Norman territories. As the Normans and their Viking predecessors continued to wage wars on English coasts, they also established important trade and cultural links. Through marriages such as the one between Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and King Ethelred II of England, the two kingdoms grew closer, leading to the eventual marriage of Ethelred to Emma in 1013.

For most of history, as living standards improved with access to more food, clean water, and fuel, people's health and life expectancy also improved. However, in recent times, this pattern has changed among some middle-income countries, and life expectancy has plateaued in the richest thirty or so countries. In the United States, life expectancy (77 years in 2004) is similar to that of Greece (78 years) and New Zealand (78 years), despite the higher per capita income in the USA. In countries like Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82 years), where income distribution was more equal, life expectancy was longer.\nAs humanity evolved, the relationship between higher living standards and better health outcomes was evident. With access to ample food, clean water, and fuel, people were able to maintain better physical health and enjoy longer lives. This pattern of improving life expectancy as income increases was observed in many countries, particularly in the poorest nations where access to basic necessities was limited. However, in recent decades, this trend has slowed down among middle-income countries and has even plateaued in some of the wealthiest nations in the world. For instance, life expectancy in the United States, a nation with high GDP per capita, is comparable to that of Greece and New Zealand, both of which have lower per capita incomes. In countries like Sweden and Japan, where income distribution is more equitable, life expectancy is notably higher, around 80 years in Sweden and 82 years in Japan.\nThroughout history, there has been a clear correlation between higher living standards and improved health outcomes. As people gained access to sufficient food, clean water, and fuel, their overall health and longevity significantly improved. This pattern was especially noticeable in poorer countries, where the improvement in life expectancy was quite rapid as per capita income increased. However, in recent years, this trend has started to slow down among middle-income countries, and it has even plateaued in some of the wealthiest nations. For example, in the United States, a nation with a high GDP per capita, life expectancy (around 77 years in 2004) is similar to that of Greece (78 years) and New Zealand (78 years). In countries like Sweden and Japan, where income distribution is more equitable, life expectancy is notably higher, around 80 years in Sweden and 82 years in Japan.\nFor centuries, the relationship between economic inequality and human well-being has been a subject of great interest and debate. As societies progressed and living standards improved, there was a clear correlation between higher incomes and longer lives. People who had access to abundant food, clean water, and fuel were more likely to maintain good health and enjoy longer lifespans. This pattern was particularly pronounced in poorer countries, where life expectancy often increased rapidly as per capita income rose. However, in recent decades, this trend has begun to slow down in some middle-income countries and has even plateaued in the wealthiest nations. In the United States, for example, life expectancy in 2004 was around 77 years, while in Greece and New Zealand, it was 78 years.

This pattern of higher incomes-longer lives still holds among poorer countries, where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases, but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world. Americans live no longer on average (about 77 years in 2004) than Greeks (78 years) or New Zealanders (78), though the USA has a higher GDP per capita. Life expectancy in Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82) – where income was more equally distributed – was longer.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Joe Barton, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote joint letters with Ed Whitfield, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations demanding full records on climate research, as well as personal information about their finances and careers, from Mann, Bradley and Hughes. Sherwood Boehlert, chairman of the House Science Committee, said this was a \"misguided and illegitimate investigation\" apparently aimed at intimidating scientists, and at his request the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arranged for its National Research Council to set up a special investigation. The National Research Council's report agreed that there were some statistical failings, but these had little effect on the graph, which was generally correct. In a 2006 letter to Nature, Mann, Bradley, and Hughes pointed out that their original article had said that \"more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached\" and that the uncertainties were \"the point of the article\".\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

          "text": "Fresno, California: A Boulevared Historic Landmark\n\nHomes from the early 20th century adorn the heart of the historic Alta Vista Tract, which stretches along Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west and Cedar Avenue on the east. This boulevard is home to many grand, imposing residences that bear witness to Fresno's rich history. The original development of this area commenced around 1910, on 190 acres that had previously been an alfalfa field. Named the Alta Vista Tract, the land was initially mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries encompassed Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street), and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, as well as First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, an event that marked the first election in which women were allowed to vote in Fresno. At the time of its inclusion in the City, the Alta Vista Tract was still undeveloped, although the landscape had been prepared for future residences. In 1914, developers Billings & Meyering took over the tract, completed street development, ensured the provision of necessary municipal improvements such as water service, and began actively promoting the property. As a result, the tract rapidly emerged as a thriving community, boasting 267 homes by 1919. The rapid development of the Alta Vista Tract was undoubtedly facilitated by the presence of the Fresno Traction Company's right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided convenient streetcar connections between downtown Fresno and the County Hospital.\n\nFresno, California: A Closer Look at the Alta Vista Tract\n\nThe historic Alta Vista Tract, located in the heart of Fresno, California, is a well-preserved reminder of the city's early 20th-century architecture. This boulevard, stretching from First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east, boasts a collection of beautifully preserved homes that date back to the early 1900s. The Alta Vista Tract, a 190-acre area, initially served as an alfalfa field before being transformed into a residential area by the Pacific Improvement Corporation in 1911. William Stranahan, the company's map creator, laid out the development, and it was officially annexed to the city in 1912, allowing women to vote for the first time in Fresno's history.\n\nThe original development of the Alta Vista Tract began around 1910, and the tract's boundaries consisted of Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street), and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, as well as First Street on the west. At the time of its annexation, the tract was still an undeveloped landscape, but it was soon to undergo significant changes. In 1914, developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the necessary municipal improvements, such as water service, and started aggressively marketing the property. As a result, the Alta Vista Tract quickly transformed into a vibrant community, boasting 267 homes by 1919.\n\nThe rapid development of the Alta Vista Tract was largely attributed to the presence of the Fresno Traction Company's right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard. This strategic transportation link provided convenient streetcar connections between downtown Fresno and the County Hospital, further boosting the tract's appeal to potential residents. The Alta Vista Tract, a testament to Fresno's rich history, continues to stand as a beautiful and well-maintained neighborhood that has preserved the city's early 20th-century architectural charm.\n\nFresno, California: The Heart of Alta Vista Tract\n\nThe historic Alta Vista Tract, situated in the heart of Fresno, California, is a remarkable example of early 20th-century architecture. Stretching along Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west and Cedar Avenue on the east, this boulevard is home to a collection of stately and picturesque homes that reflect the city's rich history. The Alta Vista Tract, originally developed in 1911, was initially a 190-acre alfalfa field that underwent a transformation into a residential area.\n\nWilliam Stranahan, a map creator for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, played a crucial role in designing the development of the Alta Vista Tract. The tract's boundaries included Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street), and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, as well as First Street on the west. In 1912, the tract was annexed to the city, and in 1914, developers Billings & Meyering took over, completing street development and providing essential municipal improvements, such as water service.\n\nThis visionary development led to the swift growth of the Alta Vista Tract, which by 1919 boasted 267 homes. The rapid development can be attributed in part to the presence of the Fresno Traction Company's right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard. This transportation link provided convenient streetcar connections between downtown Fresno and the County Hospital, making the area an attractive choice for potential residents.\n\nToday, the Alta Vista Tract continues to serve as a cherished neighborhood within Fresno, preserving the city's early 20th-century architectural heritage. The homes along Huntington Boulevard showcase the unique character and charm of this historic district, making it a beloved and enduring part of Fresno's history.",

Realizing the danger, Tesla had no choice but to use a sledgehammer to stop the experiment, just as the police arrived. In February 1912, an article titled \"Nikola Tesla, Dreamer\" by Allan L. Benson was published in World Today, featuring an artist's illustration of the entire earth cracking in half. In the article, Tesla is quoted as stating that he could set the earth's crust into a state of vibration within a few weeks, causing it to rise and fall hundreds of feet and potentially destroying civilization. Tesla further claimed that continued oscillations would eventually lead to the splitting of the earth in two.",

The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named their exhibition celebrating the programme \"Behind the Sofa\". The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time. A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill \"at the center of many people's relationship with the show\", and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the \"scariest TV show of all time\".\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

This process consists of several stages, beginning with a proposal by the Commission. At the first reading, the Parliament votes on the proposal to either approve it or suggest changes. The Council then votes on the Commission's proposed amendments, but must reach a qualified majority to block them. If the institutions cannot reach an agreement at this point, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is established, which consists of representatives from the Parliament, Council, and Commission. The Committee works to reach a joint text, which is then sent back to the Parliament and Council for approval by a simple majority and qualified majority, respectively.

Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown.

          "text": "### Traditional Rewriting\n- **Start**: January 27, 1967, marked the beginning of the plugs-out test for the Apollo program. It was filled with numerous issues from the outset. Astronauts first noticed an unusual smell in their spacesuits, causing delays in sealing the hatch. Following this, communication problems plagued the mission, leading to a simulated countdown hold. During this hold, an electrical fire ignited within the cabin. The fire quickly spread due to the high-pressure, 100% oxygen environment. This surge in pressure caused the cabin to explode, and the flames reached the pad area, making it impossible to rescue the crew members. By the time the hatch could be opened, the astronauts had succumbed to asphyxiation.\n\n### Informal Rewriting\n- **Start**: Back in 1967, they started the plugs-out test for the Apollo program. Everything went wrong right from the beginning! The astronauts smelled something weird in their suits, so they couldn't seal the hatch properly. Then, they had trouble talking to each other, which stopped their pretend countdown. While they waited, a big spark set their cabin on fire! The fire grew really fast because it was in a room full of oxygen. Suddenly, the whole room exploded, and the fire came down to the ground. No one could save the astronauts before the door opened. They ran out of air by then.\n\n### Academic Rewriting\n- **Start**: The plugs-out test of the Apollo program commenced on January 27, 1967, and encountered several challenges. Initially, the astronauts detected an unfamiliar scent in their suits, which impeded the process of sealing the hatch. Subsequently, communication difficulties hindered the simulated countdown, necessitating a halt in operations. During this pause, an electrical fire broke out inside the cabin. Due to the elevated pressure and high oxygen concentration, the fire propagated rapidly, ultimately causing the cabin to rupture. The conflagration extended beyond the cabin, reaching the pad area, thereby impeding any potential rescue efforts. Tragically, the astronauts perished due to asphyxiation before the hatch could be safely opened.\n\n### Creative Rewriting\n- **Start**: In 1967, the plugs-out test for the Apollo program began with an ominous sense of foreboding. As the astronauts suited up, a peculiar aroma permeated their spacesuits, complicating the sealing of the hatch. Communication issues then piled on, transforming the simulated countdown into a frustrating obstacle course. When the hold was called, an electrical fire ignited within the tightly pressurized cabin. Oxygen levels skyrocketed, fueling the inferno as it devoured the interior. The sudden explosion hurled the cabin's remains towards the launch pad, while the blazing inferno raged on, leaving rescuers helpless. Trapped inside the now-lethal chamber, the astronauts succumbed to asphyxiation, fatefully meeting their end before the hatch could be pryed open.",

Economic inequality has been studied extensively by economists such as Robert Barro, who discovered that there is little overall connection between income inequality and rates of growth and investment.

First, the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther, whom Leo then summoned to Rome. The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg, where the Imperial Diet was held. There, in October 1518, under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist. The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy. The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than his writing the 95 Theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope. Cajetan's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant, but the legate desisted from doing so. Luther slipped out of the city at night, unbeknownst to Cajetan.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Following a long period of military setbacks against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually declined into the late nineteenth century. The empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, but it dissolved in the aftermath of World War I, leading to the emergence of the new state of Turkey in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, as well as the creation of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states, thus ending Turkish colonial ambitions.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant \"barracks\" and could also mean \"thanks\". Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng. The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, making it more economical due to the fact that one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68 °F). These tankers are commonly used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which are located outside of hospitals and other institutions that require a large volume of pure oxygen gas.

These principles have been incorporated into 40 pieces of legislation under the European Community.\n\nExplain the importance of each version of the Social Chapter, both the original 1989 version and the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam version, and how they have impacted European Union law and social policy. Be sure to cite specific examples from the passage to support your explanation. The original 1989 version of the Social Chapter, as developed by the \"social partners\" representatives, played a significant role in laying the groundwork for the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam version. The original Social Chapter aimed to address social policy issues within the European Community by focusing on key areas such as fair remuneration, health and safety at work, rights for disabled and elderly individuals, worker rights, vocational training, and improvements in living conditions. By establishing these principles, the original Social Chapter provided a foundation for the later development of European Union law in the areas of social policy.\n\nThe 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam version of the Social Chapter built upon the principles established in the original version, while also incorporating some changes to reflect the evolving needs of the European Union. This version of the Social Chapter served as the basis for the adoption of European Community legislation on social policy issues. Over the years, this legislation has had a significant impact on European Union law and social policy, helping to ensure that workers are protected, and that individuals receive fair treatment and adequate support.\n\nSome specific examples of the impact of the Social Chapter on European Union law and social policy include:\n\n- The Working Time Directive, which sets maximum limits on working hours and ensures that workers receive adequate rest periods.\n- The Equal Treatment Directive, which prohibits discrimination in employment and occupational training on the basis of race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation.\n- The Posted Workers Directive, which protects workers who are posted to work in another European Union member state by ensuring that they are treated fairly and receive the same rights and benefits as local workers.\n- The Parental Leave Directive, which guarantees that employees are entitled to paid or unpaid leave to care for a newborn child or adoptive child.\n\nOverall, the Social Chapter has been instrumental in shaping the development of European Union law and social policy, helping to ensure that workers are protected and that individuals receive the support and rights they are entitled to. The original 1989 version of the Social Chapter provided a foundation for this work, while the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam version built upon these principles to create a comprehensive framework for addressing social policy issues within the European Union.",

The logo used in the television movie featuring the Eighth Doctor was an updated version of the logo used for the Third Doctor.

The following logo, while most associated with the Fifth Doctor, was also used for the Fourth Doctor's final season.

Different ways to teach are often referred to as pedagogy. When deciding what teaching method to use teachers consider students' background knowledge, environment, and their learning goals as well as standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority. Many times, teachers assist in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips. The increasing use of technology, specifically the rise of the internet over the past decade, has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the classroom.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law, even if it is Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation. Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby, as it were, removing the three letters l-a-w from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law.

In his theses and disputations against the antinomians, Martin Luther revisits and reaffirms the concept of the \"second use of the law,\" which refers to the law being utilized by the Holy Spirit as a tool to cultivate remorse over sin within an individual's heart. This, in turn, prepares them for the fulfillment of the law as presented in the gospel. Luther emphasizes that anything serving to instill sorrow over sin can be considered the law, whether it is Christ's life, His sacrifice on the cross, or the kindness shown in God's creation. He asserts that it would be inappropriate to refrain from preaching the Ten Commandments among Christians, as this would essentially remove the three letters \"l-a-w\" from the church. Consequently, denying the presence of the law – in any form – in the lives of Christians would imply that they are no longer inherently sinful and that the church consists solely of individuals who are fundamentally holy.\n2. In his theses and disputations against the antinomians, Martin Luther refines and restates the notion of the \"second use of the law,\" whereby the law functions as a means through which the Holy Spirit operates to instill regret over sin within a person's heart. This, in turn, prepares them for the complete realization of the law as articulated in the gospel. Luther asserts that anything that contributes to the fostering of sorrow over sin can be regarded as the law, including Christ's life, His selfless act of dying for sin, or the benevolence displayed in God's creation. He contends that if one were to abstain from preaching the Ten Commandments among Christians, it would be equivalent to eradicating the three letters \"l-a-w\" from the church. Thus, disavowing the existence of the law – in any guise – among Christians would imply that they are devoid of inherent sin and that the church comprises only individuals who possess an essential level of sanctity.\n3. In his theses and disputations against the antinomians, Martin Luther reiterates and endorses the concept of the \"second use of the law,\" whereby the law operates as an instrument employed by the Holy Spirit to engender sorrow over sin within an individual's heart. This, in turn, equips them to embrace the complete fulfillment of the law as conveyed in the gospel. Luther posits that any element capable of eliciting remorse over sin can be deemed the law, encompassing not only Christ's existence, His atoning death for sin, but also the goodness experienced in God's creation. He maintains that abstaining from the preaching of the Ten Commandments among Christians would equate to the removal of the three letters \"l-a-w\" from the church. Consequently, the rejection of the law – in any form – among Christians would imply that they are no longer fundamentally sinful and that the church consists exclusively of individuals who are innately righteous.\n4.

For mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors. However, most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant, so that indirectly the world's industry is still dependent on steam power. Recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover. This is becoming known as the Advanced Steam movement.[citation needed]\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

However, with the onset of the war, he lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries. This unfortunate turn of events led Tesla to sell Wardenclyffe for a mere $20,000, equivalent to $472,500 in today's dollars. During the same time, when Boldt demolished the Wardenclyffe Tower to transform the land into a more desirable real estate asset, Tesla was awarded the Edison Medal by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) for his outstanding achievements. This recognition served as a testament to Tesla's brilliance and hard work, despite the challenges he faced in his later years.\n2. Nikola Tesla, a pioneer in the field of electrical engineering, encountered difficulties in securing funding from European investors during World War I. As a result, Tesla lost the income he was receiving from his patents in those countries. To make matters worse, the Wardenclyffe Tower was eventually demolished by Boldt, which not only decreased the value of the land but also symbolized the unfortunate end of Tesla's once-promising venture. However, during this same period, Tesla received the Edison Medal from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), a prestigious honor that acknowledged his remarkable achievements in the field of electrical engineering. This recognition served as a bright spot in Tesla's later years, highlighting his enduring impact on the world of science and technology.\n3. In the years leading up to World War I, Nikola Tesla sought financial support from investors abroad. Unfortunately, the outbreak of the war disrupted his funding sources in Europe, leading Tesla to lose the income he was generating from his patents in those countries. This setback forced Tesla to sell the Wardenclyffe property for $20,000, which would be equivalent to $472,500 in today's dollars. Simultaneously, Boldt's decision to demolish the Wardenclyffe Tower diminished the value of the land, leaving Tesla with fewer options for future endeavors. However, amidst these challenges, Tesla was awarded the Edison Medal by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) in 1917. This prestigious honor, given to him around the time that the Wardenclyffe Tower was being dismantled, acknowledged Tesla's exceptional contributions to the field of electrical engineering and served as a testament to his enduring legacy.",

The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

          "text": "Inequality concerns\nRobert J. Shiller's 2013 Economics Nobel prize-winning research identified rising inequality as the most pressing issue, emphasizing its detrimental impact on economic growth. A growing disparity in wealth and income within societies poses significant challenges, particularly when manifested through high and persistent unemployment rates. This not only represents a gross inefficiency of resource allocation but also leads to redistributive pressures, distortions in economic activities, increased poverty levels, constraints on liquidity that hinder labor mobility, and social dislocations characterized by lower self-esteem and heightened tensions. Consequently, policies designed to mitigate unemployment, especially those targeted at reducing its associated inequalities, are crucial for fostering sustained economic growth.\n\nEconomic disparities: a pressing concern\nAccording to 2013 Economics Nobel laureate Robert J. Shiller, economic inequality stands out as the paramount problem that requires immediate attention. The escalating gap between the rich and the poor poses severe threats to economic stability and prosperity. High and enduring unemployment, often accompanied by increased inequality, has been linked to diminished long-term economic growth. Unemployment not only wastes valuable human capital but also instigates redistributive mechanisms that can lead to further economic imbalances. Furthermore, it contributes to poverty, limits financial flexibility necessary for labor mobility, and fosters social unrest due to decreased self-worth among affected individuals. To address these complexities, policies aimed at curbing unemployment and, more importantly, at lessening its inequality-driven consequences, play a pivotal role in promoting robust economic growth.\n\nInequality: an urgent challenge for economic development\nIn his acceptance speech of the 2013 Economics Nobel prize, Robert J. Shiller underscored the urgency of tackling economic inequality, highlighting its critical implications for societal progress and well-being. As inequality continues to rise, it undermines the foundations of economic stability and hinders overall growth. High and prolonged unemployment, frequently intertwined with growing inequality, has been shown to have adverse effects on long-term economic performance. Unemployment not only represents a significant waste of productive capacity but also triggers redistributive dynamics that exacerbate existing imbalances. Moreover, it perpetuates poverty, restricts access to liquidity needed for efficient labor market operations, and undermines individual dignity, thereby fueling social discord and instability. Therefore, implementing effective policies to combat unemployment and, in particular, to alleviate its impacts related to inequality, becomes essential for ensuring sustainable economic development.",

For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.",

          "text": "### Passage 1: Simplified Explanation\n\nPrime numbers are special numbers that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. For example, 5 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 5. Testing whether a number is prime can be done in two main ways: using deterministic algorithms or probabilistic ones.\n\n**Deterministic Algorithms:** These methods can definitely tell if a number is prime or not. An example is trial division, which checks all possible divisors up to the square root of the number. If no divisors are found, the number is prime. This method is very reliable but can be slow for large numbers.\n\n**Probabilistic Algorithms:** These methods are faster but not always 100% accurate. They use random checks to determine if a number is likely to be prime. If a probabilistic test passes many times in a row, the chance that the number is actually prime becomes very high, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n### Passage 2: Formal Explanation\n\nA prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if a given number \\( n \\) is prime, two primary approaches exist: deterministic and probabilistic algorithms.\n\n**Deterministic Algorithms:** These algorithms provide definitive answers about primality. For instance, trial division involves testing each integer from 2 through the square root of \\( n \\). If none of these integers divide \\( n \\), then \\( n \\) is prime. While this method is rigorous, it can become computationally expensive for very large values of \\( n \\).\n\n**Probabilistic Algorithms:** These methods are designed to be more efficient but sacrifice absolute certainty for speed. A probabilistic test might pass for primes with high probability but fail for composites. By repeating such a test multiple times, the likelihood that a composite number will pass all tests decreases exponentially. However, even after passing numerous tests, there remains a small possibility that the number could still be composite. Therefore, probabilistic methods offer strong indications of primality but do not provide a mathematical proof.\n\n### Passage 3: Detailed Comparison\n\nModern primality testing for general numbers \\( n \\) can be categorized into two main types: probabilistic and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms are robust in their ability to accurately determine whether a given number is prime or composite. An illustrative example of a deterministic algorithm is trial division, which systematically checks every integer between 2 and the square root of \\( n \\). If no divisors are discovered during this process, \\( n \\) is declared prime.\n\nConversely, probabilistic algorithms are characterized by their speed and efficiency at identifying probable primes. Unlike deterministic algorithms, probabilistic methods do not offer absolute proof but rather provide a high degree of confidence based on statistical outcomes. These algorithms operate on the principle of randomness, employing tests that may intermittently return false positives for composite numbers. Nevertheless, when these tests are executed repeatedly, the probability of mistakenly identifying a composite number as prime diminishes exponentially. Thus, while probabilistic algorithms excel in terms of computational performance, they inherently trade some degree of accuracy for speed.\n\n### Passage 4: Technical Overview\n\nIn the realm of mathematics, particularly within number theory, the identification of prime numbers plays a pivotal role. The current landscape of primality testing encompasses two distinct paradigms: deterministic and probabilistic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms are renowned for their ability to conclusively establish the primality status of a given number \\( n \\). One exemplary deterministic technique is trial division, which meticulously examines all potential divisors ranging from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). Should no divisors be encountered throughout this exhaustive search, \\( n \\) is unequivocally classified as prime.\n\nContrasting with deterministic approaches, probabilistic algorithms prioritize efficiency over infallibility. Such methods exploit stochastic processes to assess the likelihood that a number is prime. Although a single run of a probabilistic test for a composite number might yield a correct result, the risk of error is significantly reduced when the test is iteratively applied multiple times. As a consequence, the cumulative probability of erroneously categorizing a composite number as prime declines exponentially with each additional test execution. Despite their inability to guarantee flawless accuracy, probabilistic algorithms offer a pragmatic compromise between speed and reliability, making them a popular choice in practical applications where precise determination of primality is less critical than rapid computation.",

Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"

He started a group called Jamaat-e-Islami in 1941, and he was the leader of that group until 1972. But what made him really famous was his writing. He wrote many books that people all around the world could read and learn from.

But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled the ball during the return, but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession.\n\nRewritten passages:\n"
