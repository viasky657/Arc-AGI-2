## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

* Remove as much duplication as you possibly can.
* Optimize for readability, even if it means introducing duplication.
* If you've removed all the duplication, do you have a lot of
  conditionals? Try replacing the conditionals with polymorphism, if it
  applies in this language. How readable is it?

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?
