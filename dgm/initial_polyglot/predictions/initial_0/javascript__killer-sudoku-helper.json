It's been provided as a\n-// convenience to get you started writing code faster.\n+// This is the solution for the 'Killer Sudoku Helper' exercise.\n+// It generates all valid combinations for a killer sudoku cage, taking into account:\n+// - The cage's total sum\n+// - The number of cells in the cage\n+// - An optional set of digits that are already present in the house (row/column/box) and therefore cannot be used in the cage.\n //\n+// The function returns an array of strings. Each string represents a valid combination of distinct digits in ascending order.\n+// The combinations themselves are sorted in lexicographical order.\n+//\n+// The expected input is an object with the following properties:\n+//   sum: number (the total sum of the cage)\n+//   cells: number (how many cells are in the cage)\n+//   existing: optional array of digits that are not allowed in the cage due to Sudoku constraints\n+//\n+// Examples:\n+// combinations({ sum: 7, cells: 3 }) should return [\"124\"] because 1+2+4 = 7 is the only possibility for three different digits.\n+// combinations({ sum: 10, cells: 2 }) should return [\"19\", \"28\", \"37\", \"46\"].\n+// combinations({ sum: 10, cells: 2, existing: [1, 4] }) should return [\"28\", \"37\"], because digits 1 and 4 are not allowed.\n \n export const combinations = (cage) => {\n-  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');\n+  const { sum, cells, existing } = cage;\n+  // available digits are 1 to 9 minus any existing values\n+  const exclude = new Set(existing || []);\n+  const digits = [];\n+  for (let d = 1; d <= 9; d++) {\n+    if (!exclude.has(d)) {\n+      digits.push(d);\n+    }\n+  }\n+\n+  const results = [];\n+\n+  // recursive backtracking function to choose digits\n+  const backtrack = (start, current, currentSum) => {\n+    if (current.length === cells) {\n+      if (currentSum === sum) {\n+        // form a string combination from sorted digits\n+        results.push(current.join(\"\"));\n+      }\n+      return;\n+    }\n+\n+    for (let i = start; i < digits.length; i++) {\n+      const next = digits[i];\n+      // if adding next digit exceeds the sum, we can break early because digits are in increasing order\n+      if (currentSum + next > sum) continue; // we use continue instead of break because digits might not be strictly increasing in size order?
