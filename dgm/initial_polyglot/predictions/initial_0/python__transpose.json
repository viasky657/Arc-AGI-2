If the rows have different lengths, the missing characters are considered to be a space.\n+    However, only missing characters on the right (i.e. if a row is shorter) are filled with a space when transposing, but trailing fill spaces are removed unless an actual character from the input was present in that position.\n+\n+    This ensures that for example:\n+\n+      Input:\n+         ABC\n+         DE\n+      Output:\n+         AD\n+         BE\n+         C\n+\n+      and\n+\n+      Input:\n+         AB\n+         DEF\n+      Output:\n+         AD\n+         BE\n+          F\n+         (note that the missing character in the first row is replaced by a space, which is preserved because it is not trailing in the transposed column)\n+    \n+    The algorithm works by iterating over column indices from 0 to the maximum row length - 1, and for each column, taking the character from each row if it exists; if not, a space is used.\n+    Then, for each transposed row (which comes from a column of the original), we remove only the trailing fill spaces that come from missing characters, leaving intact any spaces that were originally in the input.\n+    \n+    We do this by tracking, for each column, which rows provided an actual character.
