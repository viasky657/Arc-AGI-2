# Instructions

In this exercise, you're going to implement a program that determines the state of a [tic-tac-toe][] game.
(_You may also know the game as "noughts and crosses" or "Xs and Os"._)

The game is played on a 3Ã—3 grid.
Players take turns to place `X`s and `O`s on the grid.
The game ends when one player has won by placing three of marks in a row, column, or along a diagonal of the grid, or when the entire grid is filled up.

In this exercise, we will assume that `X` starts.

It's your job to determine which state a given game is in.

There are 3 potential game states:

- The game is **ongoing**.
- The game ended in a **draw**.
- The game ended in a **win**.

If the given board is invalid, throw an appropriate error.

If a board meets the following conditions, it is invalid:

- The given board cannot be reached when turns are taken in the correct order (remember that `X` starts).
- The game was played after it already ended.

## Examples

### Ongoing game

```text
   |   |
 X |   |
___|___|___
   |   |
   | X | O
___|___|___
   |   |
 O | X |
   |   |
```

### Draw

```text
   |   |
 X | O | X
___|___|___
   |   |
 X | X | O
___|___|___
   |   |
 O | X | O
   |   |
```

### Win

```text
   |   |
 X | X | X
___|___|___
   |   |
   | O | O
___|___|___
   |   |
   |   |
   |   |
```

### Invalid

#### Wrong turn order

```text
   |   |
 O | O | X
___|___|___
   |   |
   |   |
___|___|___
   |   |
   |   |
   |   |
```

#### Continued playing after win

```text
   |   |
 X | X | X
___|___|___
   |   |
 O | O | O
___|___|___
   |   |
   |   |
   |   |
```

Your task is to make changes to the files in the /testbed/ directory to address the <problem_description>. I have already taken care of the required dependencies.


Please analyze the problem description carefully. Then make edits to the code files to complete the instruction.
